The scripts in this directory are executed when booting the system. They
are executed even when going into single user mode. The files are all symbolic
links, the real files are located in /etc/init.d/ For a more general
discussion of this technique, see /etc/init.d/README.

The following sequence points are defined at this time:

* After the S40 scripts have executed, all local file systems are mounted
  and networking is available. All device drivers have been initialized.

* After the S60 scripts have executed, the system clock has been set, NFS
  filesystems have been mounted (unless the system depends on the automounter,
  which is started later) and the filesystems have been cleaned.
