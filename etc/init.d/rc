# rc		This file is responsible for starting/stopping
#		services when the runlevel changes.
#
#		Optimization feature:
#		A startup script is _not_ run when the service was
#		running in the previous runlevel and it wasn't stopped
#		in the runlevel transition (most Debian services don't
#		have K?? links in rc{1,2,3,4,5} )
