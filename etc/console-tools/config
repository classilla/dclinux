# This files tells the console-tools package:
#
# - whether to load a specific font and boot (and maybe a screen-font map,
# but you should avoid that if possible).
# - whether to setup an Application-Charset Map other than the default CP437.
# - whether to start "vcstime" to have time on all text VC'S.
#
# You can also specify per-VC settings by suffixing variable names as in
# the examples below.
#
# CAVEATS:
#
# - When using the new framebuffer devices, the "global setting" for a font 
# only affects the current console (ie., at boot-time, the first one)
# - ACM setting involves 2 steps (maybe loading a user ACM, and activating
# it on a given charset slot - see charset(1) for details), the 1st of which
# affects the entire system, but the 2nd of which only affects the current
# VC (ie., at boot-time, the first one).  So that if you want to use the same 
# ACM on all VCs, you have to specify "APP_CHARSET_MAP_vc<N>=user" for all
# relevant values of <N>.
#
# Example:
#
#SCREEN_FONT=iso01.f16
#SCREEN_FONT_vc2=LatArCyrHeb-16
#
#APP_CHARSET_MAP=iso05
#APP_CHARSET_MAP_vc2=user
#
#DO_VCSTIME=yes
#
# Forget this one unless you _know_ it is necessary for your font:
#SCREEN_FONT_MAP=iso01
