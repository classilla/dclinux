ENABLED="no"
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Change this to "yes" to ENABLE.
# If you change this to "no", then running ipchains -F might be needed!

SAVEONCE="no"
# If this option is ENABLED (e.g. "yes"), then stopping the script won't
# couse the saving of the actual rules, only manual 'save' will do that.

SAVEFILEHEADER="#
# Automatically generated by '$0 stop|save|store' from
# kernel's IP chains at '`date`' (last reboot?).
#
# Edit kernel's IP chains with the ipchains utility, and
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. When you've finished you can run
# '$0 save' to update this file (if you like).
#
# If you want to restore your saved IP chains from this file
# execute '$0 load'.
