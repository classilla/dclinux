 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 75 dots

 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 The fonts from this package are not designed for big monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).  You can find big fonts in
 the package xfonts-cronyx-koi8r-100dpi.
 .
 The fonts are modified (mainly with Cyrillics added) versions of the
 most important X-Window fonts from 75dpi/.  Unfortunately Lucida is
 a regustered trademark, so these fonts use the name Serene inplace
 of Lucida.

Description: Source only package for building djbdns
 The following were taken from various HTML pages under
 http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html/
 .
 dnscache is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive DNS queries from local
 clients such as web browsers and mail transfer agents. It collects
 responses from remote DNS servers. It caches the responses to save time later.
 .
 tinydns is a DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from hosts around the
 Internet, and responds with locally configured information.
 .
 pickdns is a load-balancing DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from
 hosts around the Internet, and responds with a dynamic selection of locally
 configured IP addresses with 5-second TTLs.
 .
 walldns is a reverse DNS wall. It accepts iterative DNS queries for in-addr.arpa
 domains from hosts around the Internet, and supplies generic responses that avoid
 revealing local host information.
 .
 rbldns is an IP-address-listing DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from
 hosts around the Internet asking about various IP addresses.  It provides responses
 showing whether the addresses are on a locally configured list, such as RBL or DUL.
 .
 axfrdns is a DNS zone-transfer server. It reads a zone-transfer request in
 DNS-over-TCP format from its standard input, and responds with locally configured
 information.
 .
 The security of this software is guaranteed by the author.  Details of the guarantee

 (and thus to X clients).  All X servers have the ability to serve locally
 installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it possible to offload that job
 from the X server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a networked
 machine running xfs so that all the machines running X servers on a network do
 not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by users to, for
 instance, make available X fonts in user accounts that are not available to
 the X server or to an already running system xfs-xtt.

Description: SQL database and parser generator in Python
 Gadfly is a relational database management system which uses a
 large subset of very standard SQL as its query language and Python
 modules and optional Python/C extension modules as its underlying
 engine.  Gadfly stores the active database in memory, with recovery
 logging to a file system. It supports an optional TCP/IP based
 client server mode and log based failure recovery for system or
 software failures (but not for disk failures).
 .
 kwParser, included as part of the Gadfly package, is a parser
 generator for Python.  It transforms an abstract specification of a
 language grammar (for example the CORBA Interface Definition Language)
 together with "interpretation functions" that define the semantics of
 the language into a compiler or translator or interpreter.

Description: create a skeleton source package for a new program
 autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for a
 new program which follows the GNU programming standards.  The new
 package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create the
 Makefile.  `make distcheck' succeeds.
 .
 The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start a
 new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new directory
 and populate it with standard files, customized for the new project.
 .
 Optionally, the new package will use a command line parser generator.
 Currently, autoproject supports two parser generators: clig by Harald
 Kirsch <kir@iitb.fhg.de> (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/software/), and
 autogen by Bruce Korb <korbb@datadesign.com> (see

 flon simply uses the ~/.friends file to instruct it on which
 users to display. Flon can also act like a BSD style who(1),
 if invoked with the -w option or from a symlink named 'who'.
 .
 to is rather like write(1), except that it accepts input as
 command line arguments rather than on the standard input.
 It uses ~/.torc for configuration, and can be configured
 to autoreply to messages in different ways depending on
 whether you're logged in or not or if your terminal is
 idle, and can also exclude individual users from sending
 messages to your terminal.

Description: Expect.pm (1.10) - Perl Expect interface
 The Expect module is a successor of Comm.pl and a descendent of Chat.pl. It
 more closely ressembles the Tcl Expect language than its predecessors. It
 does not contain any of the networking code found in Comm.pl. I suspect this
 would be obsolete anyway given the advent of IO::Socket and external tools
 such as netcat.
 .
 Expect.pm is an attempt to have more of a switch() & case: feel to make
 decision processing more fluid. three separate types of debugging have
 been implemented to make code production easier.
 .
 It is now possible to interconnect multiple file handles (and processes) much
 like Tcl's expect. An attempt was made to enable all the features of Tcl's
 expect without forcing Tcl on the victim programmer :-) .

Description: The GNU Parted disk partitioning library, development files
 The GNU Parted library is a disk partitioning and partition
 resizing library. It contains an API which allows you to
 create, destroy, resize, move and copy hard disk partitions.
 This package contains the debugging static library for
 libparted, which are really only of interest to parted
 developers who need to debug their programs.
 .
 The debugging libraries are installed as /usr/lib/libparted_g.a
 Link specifically with them if you want to debug.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD and PC98
 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk)
 type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems supported are
 ext2, fat (FAT16 and FAT32) and linux-swap. Parted can also
 detect hfs (Mac OS), ntfs, reiserfs and ufs filesystems, but
 cannot create/remove/resize/check these filesystems yet.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

 The rawrec/rawplay utilities provide a simple way to record or play
 back raw audio data.  Options exist to control the timing of the run,
 add silent guard time, jump into data files, set DSP parameters, and
 control buffer size and latency.  rawrec should be particularly useful
 for scripting applications that need to deal with raw audio data.
 .
 Compared to bplay, rawrec tries to do less (it only handles raw
 audio) and does it more correctly (all the options work right for raw
 audio.  I think :).
 .
 rawrec can work to or from standard io, so if you also get the sox
 program, you will be able to record of play a wide variety of sound
 files.  You will need a mixer program, such as aumix.

Description: Creating HTML using LaTeX documents.
 Hyperlatex allows you to use a LaTeX-like language to prepare
 documents in HTML (the hypertext markup language used by the world
 wide web), and, at the same time, to produce a fine printed document
 from your input. You can use all of LaTeX's power for the printed
 output, and you don't have to learn a new language for creating
 hypertext documents.
 .
 Note that Hyperlatex is not meant to translate arbitrary Latex files
 into HTML. Rather, it provides an authoring environment for writing
 printed documents and HTML documents at the same time, using an
 extended subset of Latex (excluding concepts that have no HTML
 counterpart and adding commands for new HTML concepts such as
 hyperlinks or included images).

Description: Picon (Personal Images) database of common accounts and misc.
 "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into
 databases so that the appropriate image for a given e-mail address can
 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

 Aterm is a colour vt102 terminal emulator, based on rxvt 2.4.8 with
 some additions of fast transparency, intended as an xterm replacement
 for users who do not require features such as Tektronix 4014
 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As a result, aterm uses
 much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving
 many X sessions. It was created with AfterStep Window Manager users
 in mind, but is not tied to any libraries, and can be used anywhere.
 .
 This package contains four aterm binaries: katerm and caterm, for Japanese
 and Chinese characters support; gaterm, which supports ELOT-928
 (ISO-8859-7 standard) and IBM-437 keyboard translations for Greek character
 entry, and taterm for Thai characters support.

 `chronyd'.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the
 system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the
 system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
 time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
 enter the correct time by hand (using `chronyc').  In either case,
 `chronyd' determines the rate at which the computer gains or loses
 time, and compensates for this.
 `chronyc'.  This is a command-line driven control and monitoring
 program.  An administrator can use this to fine-tune various
 parameters within the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the
 daemon is running.

Description: A Package dependency checker and install ordering tool
 It does dependency checks, if you wish. It knows the difference
 between installed, new (and available) packages, and the relationship
 fields (pre-depends, depends, recommends, and suggests). (For
 example, the current packages list need not be read in unless you
 want dependency checks; you may already have done that and now merely
 wish an ordering). It comes with a Test::Harness test suite, to
 protect the world against my typos. Oh, it knows about epochs as well
 if your dpkg does. This could be the basis of mass compiling the
 packages on a new architecture, or to build a release from scratch.
 .
 It creates associative arrays of currently installed packages
 (/var/lib/dpkg/status), and new packages (given a packages file at
 the command line). Then, in the checking dependency phase, for each
 package in the new packages list, it looks at the dependencies, and
 ensure that each dependency is satisfied in either the new list or
 the installed list. If the directive is satisfied from the list of
 new packages, that package is added to the list of packages to be
 topographically sorted. It understands Pre-Depends and will insert
 breaks into the sorted list to separate the installation process into
 separate runs as required to satisfy Pre-Dependencies.
 .
 All this is a set of perl5 libraries, so people may use the API in
 their own scripts.

Description: create and render 3-d scenes
 This is SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor, version 3.1.  SIPP is a
 library for creating 3-dimensional scenes and rendering them using a
 scan-line z-buffer algorithm.  A scene is built up of objects which
 can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The
 objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many
 subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected
 polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat
 shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the
 polygon edges without any shading at all.
 .
 The library supports texture mapping with textures in up to
 3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates.
 Simple anti-aliasing can be performed through oversampling.  A scene
 can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources and a
 number of different lightsources are availaible.  The light from some
 of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.  A basic shading
 algorithm is provided with the library, but the user can also use his
 own shading algorithms for each surface to produce special effects.
 Objects can have varying degree of transparency, controlled by the
 shader.

 up, and a new level is generated. If you collide with a ghost, all the pills
 are replaced, and you restart the current level from scratch. A new feature
 just added is the presence of large red pills that for a short time turn the

Description: Perl module for writing XML documents
 XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML
 document.  The module handles all escaping for attribute values and
 character data and constructs different types of markup, such as
 tags, comments, and processing instructions.
 .
 By default, the module performs several well-formedness checks to
 catch errors during output.  This behaviour can be extremely useful
 during development and debugging, but it can be turned off for
 production-grade code.
 .
 The module can operate either in regular mode in or Namespace
 processing mode.  In Namespace mode, the module will generate
 Namespace Declarations itself, and will perform additional checks on
 the output.
 .
 Additional support is available for a simplified data mode with no
 mixed content: newlines are automatically inserted around elements
 and elements can optionally be indented based as their nesting
 level.

Description: The headers and static libraries for ext2fs-aware tools-development.
 EXT2FS stands for "Extended Filesystem", version 2. It's the filesystem
 type used for hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and shared libraries needed to compile
 ext2fs-aware programs. Only programmers that really manipulate
 features specific to the ext2 filesystem will need this. Most
 programmers will use the generic filesystem-independent interface
 from libc.
 .
 It also contains dev files for the e2p lib used by
 the e2fsprogs, but which is not yet packaged all by itself
 because it lacks documentation. It may also lack some support
 files, by I can't really know until someone uses it...
 .
 libe2p is for user-level e2fsprogs commands.  It's used by dumpe2fs,
 chattr, and lsattr.  Functions in libe2p typically have two
 characteristics (a) don't require that block device containing the
 filesystem be opened directly (functions in libext2fs do), and (b)
 libe2p typically contains printf statements or parse user input, and so
 have more internationalization issues.

 new domain name is resolved of the form "2.0.0.127.domain.name.com", where
 2.0.0.127 is the abusive IP address in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127
 would be the IP address 127.0.0.2), and "domain.name.com" is the base
 domain name of the filtering service (such as "rbl.maps.vix.com", for the
 MAPS project RBL filter).

MD5sum: 98896caadd030dd6578c73ed2567b356
Description: User daemon that tracks URLs looked at and logs them.
 Browser-history came from the will to overcome a Netscape bug: there is no
 global history, and if you close a window, its whole history is lost. For
 people browsing lots of sites, having the possibility of backtracking to
 where one has been before means that you don't have to put everything in
 your bookmarks file. If you are not sure if a site may be worth
 remembering, don't add it in your bookmarks. If you need it later, just
 browse your history files.
 .
 It works with: Netscape Navigator, Arena, and Amaya. Support for
 `browser-history' can easily be added to other browsers, provided you can
 program and have the browser sources.
 .
 A manual page and simple documentation will be installed in
 /usr/share/doc/browser-history/browser-history.html, along with a simple
 CGI interface to grep the history log and display the result.  The optional
 CGI program requires `cgiwrap' or Apache configured with `suexec'.

Description: Tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
 The main purpose of cfengine is to allow the system administrator
 to create a single central file which will define how every host
 on a network should be configured.
 .
 cfengine is also useful as an interpreter for a general scripting
 language for ordinary users.  It is handy for tidying up junk files
 and for maintaining `watchdog' scripts to manage access rights and
 permissions on files when collaborating with other users.
 .
 It takes a while to set up cfengine for a network (especially an
 already existing network), but once that is done you will wonder
 how you ever lived without it!

Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

 otp  creates  key  and password lists for verification and

 random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of En-
 glish text (easier to remember when transcribing, but less
 secure).
 .
 For  computer  applications,  for  example  one-time login
 passwords, otp can create a file containing the MD5 signa-
 ture of each of the generated keys.  This permits the com-
 puter to verify keys without the need to store the keys in
 plaintext.

 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In most
 cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or small
 screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: Source only package for building ucspi-tcp binary package
 Written by Dan J. Bernstein, tcpclient and tcpserver are
 powerful easy-to-use command-line tools for building TCP
 client-server applications. tcpserver provides TCP access control
 features, similar to tcp-wrappers/tcpd's hosts.allow but much
 faster; it can run high-availability services much better than
 inetd.
 .
 Real-time Blocking List support is also included in tcpserver, so
 you can run qmail-smtpd with it and avoid a lot of SPAM.
 .
 tcpclient and tcpserver conform to UCSPI, the UNIX Client-Server
 Program Interface, using the TCP protocol.
 .
 Dan Bernstein (ucspi-tcp's author) only gives permission for his code
 to be distributed in source form, or binary by approval.  This package
 has been put together to allow people to easily build a binary

Description: Reload changed modules in a mod_perl environment
 This module is two things. First it is an adaptation of Randal
 Schwartz's Stonehenge::Reload module that attempts to be a little
 more intuitive and makes the usage easier.  Stonehenge::Reload was
 written by Randal to make specific modules reload themselves when
 they changed. Unlike Apache::StatINC, Stonehenge::Reload only checked
 the change time of modules that registered themselves with
 Stonehenge::Reload, thus reducing stat() calls. Apache::Reload also
 offers the exact same functionality as Apache::StatINC, and is thus
 designed to be a drop-in replacement. Apache::Reload only checks
 modules that register themselves with Apache::Reload if you
 explicitly turn off the StatINC emulation method (see below). Like
 Apache::StatINC, Apache::Reload must be installed as an Init Handler.

Description: Python script development environment
 Packages that allow you to develop scripts and and simple applications
 in Python.
 .
 Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language.  It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.
 .
 Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has
 modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
 dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and
 libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
 Mac, MFC).  New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++.
 Python is also usable as an extension language for applications that
 need a programmable interface.
 .
 You may also want to install one of the following editing environments,
 each of which has support for Python syntax highlighting:
     python-elisp (with any of the emacsen)
     vim-python
     nedit
 .
 Overview of the task-python packages
 .
   Install:            if you want to:
   -------             ---------------
   task-python         write scripts and uncomplicated Python applications
   task-python-web     write CGI scripts and web applications in Python
   task-python-bundle  have the entire upstream (www.python.org) distribution
   task-python-dev     write complex Python applications, have available
                         most of the Debian-packaged Python extensions, and/or
                         write Python extensions in other programming languages
 .
 (Note that you needn't install any of these to be able to use
 other packages that are written in Python; the required pieces
 will be automatically installed along with the packages that need
 them.
 .
 You may later remove these task-* packages without losing
 anything else.)

Description: An easy way of transcribing folk and traditional music
 ABC2MTeX is a package written to typeset tunes stored in an ascii
 format or abc notation.  It was designed primarily for folk and
 traditional tunes of Western European origin (such as Irish, English
 and Scottish) which can be written on one stave in standard classical
 notation.  However, it can act as a fast preprocessor for multi-stave
 music and should be extendible to many other types of music.
 .
 The package is small, easy to use and features, amongst other things,
 the ability to transpose both the music and the abc notation.  It
 will also create an index of all the tunes you have transcribed.
 .
 The ability to write tunes in abc notation means that they can be
 easily and portably stored or transported electronically.  This
 package allows you to typeset them easily too.  In addition the
 notation is not specifically tied to MusicTeX and similar packages
 have been written to translate to other formats such as postscript

MD5sum: c7ff7cf5d4ed85bbfdd9d637a7015c70
Description: Securely initializes IP Masquerade forwarding/firewalling
 This package contains scripts to initialize IP Masquerade for use as a
 firewall.  IP Masquerade is a feature of Linux that allows an entire network
 of computers to be connected to another network (usually the Internet) with
 only one network address on the other network.  IP Masquerade is often
 referred to as NAT (Network Address Translation) on other platforms.
 .
 By default, this package configures the system as a basic forwarding
 firewall, with IP spoofing and stuffed routing protection.  The firewall
 will allow hosts behind the firewall to get to the Internet, but not allow
 connections from the Internet to reach the hosts behind the firewall.
 However, ipmasq now features a very flexible framework where you can
 override any of the predefined rules if you so choose.  It also allows you
 to control if the rules are reinterpreted when pppd brings a link up or
 down.
 .
 This package should be installed on the firewall host and not on the
 hosts behind the firewall.
 .
 IP Masquerade requires the kernel to be compiled with CONFIG_FIREWALL,
 CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL, CONFIG_IP_FORWARD, and CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE.

Description: Revised(5) Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
 The report gives a defining description of the programming language
 Scheme.  Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive
 dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis
 Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was designed to have an
 exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to
 form expressions.  A wide variety of programming paradigms, including
 imperative, functional, and message passing styles, find convenient
 expression in Scheme.

Description: WMF conversion development libraries and headers
 Windows Metafile (WMF) is a picture format used by many Windows
 programs, e.g. Microsoft Word.  libwmf is a set of libraries for
 converting WMF files into other formats.  Currently it supports a gd
 binding for conversion to PNG, and an X one for drawing directly to an
 X window or pixmap.  There is experimental support for the XFig format
 and Encapsulated PostScript.
 .
 This package contains the development support files.

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recomments", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: a cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

Description: standard fonts for X
 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 If you are not using a remote font server, you must install this package if
 you are installing an X server.  It contains fonts without which X servers
 will not work.
 .
 This package also provides a set of files that can be used by the X or
 fonts server to transcode fonts from one encoding to another (e.g., KOI8-R
 to ISO-8859-5).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: Binary Editor And Viewer (beav)
 beav is an editor for binary files containing arbitrary
 data. Text file editors, on the other hand, expect the
 files they edit to contain textual data, and/or to be
 formatted in a certain way (e.g. lines of printable
 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY. You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode. You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes. Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats. While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file. The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format. Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 you slip into another reality: a collection of allegorical worlds,
 full of haunting images, strange noises and atmospheric landscapes.

 Andrew Plotkin, the author of So Far, writes:
 .
 "This is a shortish-to-medium-sized game.  More than a short story,
 less than a full-length novel.  Its rating is `cruel.'  It is possible
 to make mistakes which will prevent you from winning.  Sometimes common
 sense will serve to avoid such mistakes; sometimes insight is necessary;
 sometimes neither will help.  Save often, and keep your old saved games.
 .
 "Do not expect `So Far' to be anything like `A Change in the Weather'.
 It's not."
 .
 You'll need a Z-code (i.e. Infocom-format) game interpreter, such as
 XZip or Frotz, to run this game.

 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks.

Description: Graham Stoney's mechanized man page generator
 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 Features:
  * generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  * handles comments as part of the language grammar
  * automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  * handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
 Problems:
  * doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)

Description: Quantum Mechanic entanglement of variables in perl
 One of the more popular interpretations of quantum mechanics holds that
 instead of particles always being in a single, well defined, state
 they instead exist as an almost ghostly overlay of many different
 states (or values) at the same time.  Of course, it is our experience
 that when we look at something, we only ever find it in one single state.
 This is explained by the many states of the particle collapsing to a
 single state and highlights the importance of observation.
 .
 Essentially, this allows you to put variables into a superposition
 of states, have them interact with each other (so that all states
 interact) and then observe them (testing to see if they satisfy
 some comparison operator, printing them) which will collapse
 the entire system so that it is consistent with your knowledge.

 "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into

 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

 generally trying to avoid all the packing.  Aunt Jemima is potting daisies
 and sulking; the attics are full of endless distractions and secrets; Greek
 myths, horoscopes, sixth-century politics, a less than altogether helpful
 demon, a mysterious bomb plot, photography, ritual, poetry and a dream or
 two all get in your way; and somehow you keep being reminded of your family
 through the ages, and all its Curses...
 .
 -- could it be that even you are Cursed?
 .
 You'll need a Z-code (i.e. Infocom-format) game interpreter, such as

Description: Text-based/X11 overhead view D&D-style adventure game
 Nethack is a wonderfully silly, yet quite addicting, Dungeons and
 Dragons-style adventure game. You play the part of a fierce fighter,
 wizard, or any of many other classes, fighting your way down to
 retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (try saying THAT one backwards!) for
 your god. On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two,
 or perhaps a microscopic space fleet, or -- if you're REALLY lucky --
 the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
 .
 There is a nethack-spoilers package available, if you're really
 desparate.
 .
 A few utilities -- recover, for retrieving your auto-save files in case
 of a power failure, and dgn_comp and lev_comp, two utilities for making
 your own Nethack levels and dungeons, have been included in
 /usr/lib/games/nethack. 'recover' will be run every time your system
 boots, if there are any auto-save files available.

 security monitoring, network debugging, etc.
 .
 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for
 packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this
 functionality, we've created this system-independent API to ease in
 porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet
 capture modules in each application.

    uses 2048 bytes for the header and 24 bytes per record.
  - Maximum database size is 4GB; individual record size is not
    otherwise limited.
  - Portable file format.
  - Fast creation of new databases.
  - No locking, updates are atomical.

Description: Support multimethods and subroutine overloading in Perl
 Sometimes Perl's standard polymorphic method dispatch mechanism isn't
 sophisticated enough to cope with the complexities of finding the right
 method to handle a given situation.
 .
 Generally speaking, multiple dispatch is needed whenever two or more objects
 belonging to different class hierarchies are going to interact, and we need to
 do different things depending on the combination of actual types of those
 objects. Typical applications that need this kind of ability include graphical
 user interfaces, image processing libraries, mixed-precision numerical
 computation systems, and most types of simulations.

Description: Install only wanted Debian packages
 debfoster is a wrapper program for apt and dpkg.  When first run, it
 will ask you which of the installed packages you want to keep
 installed.
 .
 After that, it maintains a list of packages that you want to have
 installed on your system.  It uses this list to detect packages that
 have been installed only because other packages depended on them.  If
 one of these dependencies changes, debfoster will take notice, and
 ask if you want to remove the old package.
 .
 This helps you to maintain a clean Debian install, without old
 (mainly library) packages lying around that aren't used any more.

 Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories can have
 an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
 not needed).  Advanced features like multiple password files and
 upload/download ratios are also supported.
 .

Description: command-line source browsing tool.
 cgvg is a pair of Perl scripts ("cg" and "vg") which are meant to
 assist a programmer in doing command-line source browsing.
 .
 The idea is you can easily search for keywords in the code, and jump
 to the file and line where a match is found. Used with ctags(1), this
 can really help with jumping around and following code. Some features
 include a human-readable output, coloring, bolding (and alternate
 bolding), and just sheer convenience for a programmer.
 .
 cgvg uses the Perl internal find and does it's own searching, rather
 than being a wrapper for UNIX find(1) and grep(1). There is a
 ~/.cgvgrc file for per-user configuration, and some nice features
 like coloring, and multiple log files.

Description: a mirroring utility for backing up your files
 Backup Copy is basically a smart copy program that allows a user to
 copy mass files from one place to another.  When coping over a
 previous copy, the key features will allow coping only of new or non
 existing files in the backup.  This results in saving time and less
 load on the drive.  Built into the same feature of copying new files
 only, is a file removal procedure.  If a file is removed from the
 source path, the same file will be removed when the next backup is
 performed.  This provides a backup that is exactly the same as the
 source without filling up the drive.  As an added option, all files
 that will be overwritten or deleted when doing a copy over a previous
 backup, have the opportunity to be stored in a trash bin.  You can
 leave this trash bin to grow and grow just in case you need a backup
 of your backup.  When you start running out of disk space you will
 need to remove or clean up the trash bin.

 These are the CMUCL sources, provided so that the
 debugger can show useful source information at appropriate
 times.
 .
 This version includes common-lisp-controller compatible
 replacements for defsystem, graystream, clx and hemlock.
 .
 defsystem provides a "make" type system for Lisp. This is
 a patched version from clocc.
 .
 Gray streams are the usual Lisp streams, but re-implemented
 as a Object hierarchy. Users can subclass existing classes and
 adapt them for their own needs.
 .
 cmucl-clx is the clx library adapted for CMUCL. clx is an
 interface to X11, just like xlib.
 .
 Hemlock is an emacs clone for CMUCL.
 .
 Note that this version only works in X, the tty interface
 is broken: the system can't parse /etc/termcap.
 .
 To open the editor, type "(ed)".
 .
 Note that to recompile CMUCL you need a working CMUCL system :-(

Description: Development libraries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains header files and development libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 repetitive work: common design elements (headers, footers, menus,
 logos) can be extracted into their own components where they need be
 changed only once to affect the whole site.
 .
 Other Mason features include a graphical site previewing utility, an
 HTML/data caching model, and the ability to walk through requests with
 the Perl debugger.

Description: SGML text formatting system based on DocBook
 A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
 Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and
 plain ASCII (currently via w3m by default) from a single source; due
 to the flexible nature of SGML many other target formats are possible.
 .
 HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package,
 but for the other formats the appropriate packages have to be installed.
 You need to install lynx or w3m for ASCII text output (w3m is the default
 for txt backend). Also jadetex is required also for PS and PDF, and
 linuxdoc-tools is required for ld2db conversion.
 .
 This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation,
 an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents. However, there is
 nothing Linux-specific about this package; it can be used for many
 other types of documentation on many other systems. It should be
 useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation.
 .
 The package was formerly called Linuxdoc-SGML because it originates
 from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP). The name has been changed
 into SGMLtools to make it clearer that there is no Linux-specific
 stuff included in this package.
 .
 This is the latest version of SGMLtools series and the successor of
 SGML-Tools v2.

Description: A lexer, parser-generator, and parser written in elisp
 The Semantic Bovinator's goal is to provide an intermediate API for
 authors of language agnostic tools who want to deal with languages in
 a generic way.  It also provides a simple way for Mode Authors who
 are expert's in their language, to provide a parser for those tool
 authors, without knowing anything about those tools.
 .
 The Semantic Bovinator is made up of these important pieces:
  - lexer: Converts a language into a token stream
  - parser: Converts a token stream into a stream of nonterminals
    defined by the language.
  - parser-generator: Converts a language definition into a table
    usable by the parser. (Written using the Semantic Bovinator)
  - Language Definitions: Parsers already existing for the parser
    generator language (Bovine Normal Form), Emacs Lisp, and C.
  - speedbar browser: Code for browsing a generated nonterminal list
    with Speedbar.
  - Documentation generator: Identifies inline documentation in source
    code, and can convert it to  texinfo.  It can also create inline
    documenation.

Description: A Change in the Weather, an interactive short story
 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you wander away

 You come across a chattering stream, a weathered old wooden bridge,
 a tall lone tree and a weatherbeaten shed.  After a strange dream,
 you embark on a mission; but there's hardly enough time to succeed...

 Andrew Plotkin, the author of A Change in the Weather, writes:
 .
 "A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER is a cruel game, by the Zarfian Interactive
 Fiction Rating System. Any choice you make may be a wrong choice,
 and you may not discover it was wrong until later; and not choosing is
 always a choice.  Timing may be critical. Save often and keep your old
 saved games."

 XZip or Frotz, to run this game.

Description: Simple e-commerce system for Zope
 Basically an EMarket is a folderish object that (currently) consists
 of a set of methods and five folderish 'Specialists'. Each specialist
 is responsible for managing one particular type of object. They have
 methods, and racks: methods to interface to the rest of the application,
 and racks to handle the storage and retrieval of the objects
 they manage:
 .
 marketItems: manage the market items in the EMarket
 .
 shoppers: manage the shopper objects
 .
 basketManager: manage the 'shopping baskets'
 .
 basketItemManager: manage the items in the shopping baskets.
 .
 transactions: manage the completed transactions
 .
 The idea here is to provide a framework for a 'shopping area' that is
 at once flexible, simple, and reasonably robust. The display of the
 market area is determined by editable templates that are contained in
 the marketItems folder. The display of the shopping 'Baskets' is
 managed by templates in the shoppers folder. This way each EMarket can
 be customized easily. Also, the developer picks the classes they
 want to use for shoppers, marketItems, etc... so they can also be used
 to customize the look and feel of the market.

Description: NetBSD /bin/sh
 "ash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "ash", and is a required part of the system.

 number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and because this
 is more efficient), we bounce it with an error message during the
 SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later.
 .
 This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or another TCP security
 daemon to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The
 advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote
 SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a
 polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and whom to call
 to get around the blocking.
 .
 Other, more automated solutions such as RBL and ORBS (supported by
 most of the mail transfer agents), have become available since
 smtp-refuser was written, but this may still be of interest to you.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partitioning library, development files
 The GNU Parted library is a disk partitioning and partition
 resizing library. It contains an API which allows you to
 create, destroy, resize, move and copy hard disk partitions.
 This package contains the static library and header files
 for libparted, which are really only of interest to parted
 developers.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD and PC98
 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk)
 type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems supported are
 ext2, fat (FAT16 and FAT32) and linux-swap. Parted can also
 detect hfs (Mac OS), ntfs, reiserfs and ufs filesystems, but
 cannot create/remove/resize/check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Please note that libparted1.4 packages are actually
 newer than the libparted2 packages. I have re-numbered the
 packages because of problems with new, incompatible versions
 of libparted being released, and also to create more
 consistency of version numbers across the package. See
 README.Debian for more details.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

 math from an early age.  Other packages allow children to explore and

 are more general, providing math activities as only one part of the

 non-math games, gcompris provides math exercises for the very
 young as well as other non-math activities, and xbase-clients
 provides xcalc.

 pages on a website. No more proprietary Fusion, FrontPage, or other
 extensions, but a standardized way to work with a (web)
 server. However, DAV is capable of much more than simple authoring --
 a quick review of the mailing lists shows that it is being envisioned
 for document management systems, complex configuration management
 systems (aka version control, source control; e.g. CVS), and all
 other kinds of nifty web-based data repositories. A rude paraphrase
 of its capabilities would be to say that it is a web-based
 filesystem, augmented with properties on the directories and files.

Description: Development files for the GNOME XML library
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
 A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
 a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
 own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
 can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
 metalanguage for markup languages.
 .
 Install this package if you wish to develop your own programs using
 the GNOME XML library.

Description: a satellite location program
 Seesat5 uses the NORAD sgp4 algorithm to compute the location of a satellite.
 Many different filtering methods are provided by Seesat5 so that only those
 satellites that might actually be viewed are presented in the report. This
 report includes bearing and elevation with respect to the observer's location
 as well as other information of interest to the observer.
 .
 Although an observer would find no use for it, the program can be made to
 report the location even when it is below the horizon. For radio satellites
 like the Oscar series knowing when it comes above the horizon is some of the
 interesting information this program can provide.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor.
 Contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of
 the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
 transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
 excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 This module provides a basic framework for creating and maintaining
 RDF Site Summary (RSS) files.  This distribution also contains many
 examples that allow you to generate HTML from an RSS, convert between
 0.9, 0.91, and 1.0 version, and other nifty things.  This might be
 helpful if you want to include news feeds on your Web site from
 sources like Slashot and Freshmeat or if you want to syndicate your
 own content.
 .
 XML::RSS currently supports 0.9, 0.91, and 1.0 versions of RSS.  See
 http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/mnn20/quickstart.html for
 information on RSS 0.91.  See http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/
 for RSS 0.9.  See http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ for RSS 1.0.
 .
 RSS was originally developed by Netscape as the format for Netscape
 Netcenter channels, however, many Web sites have since adopted it as
 a simple syndication format.  With the advent of RSS 1.0, users are
 now able to syndication many different kinds of content including
 news headlines, threaded measages, products catalogs, etc.

 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-koi8u-100dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-koi8u-75dpi may be
 more suitable for small monitors and/or small screen resolutions
 (under 1024x768).

 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.  Xcyr has all Slavic Cyrillic letters and includes many other
 symbols.

 FTP, for moving files around.  It's designed for anonymous archives, and
 has protection against server and network overloading.  It doesn't use
 connections, so it can survive things falling over.  It's also designed to
 prevent network congestion, so it can be very nice for large transfers over
 slow links.

Description: GTK-based Notepad editor
 This is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple text editor
 for Unix based systems running X11 and using GTK (the Gimp ToolKit).
 Gnotepad+ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while
 still providing many of the common features found in a modern
 GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially
 for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way.
 .
 The "+" in gnotepad+ is there to differentiate it from other
 GTK-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad".
 Additionally, gnotepad+ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages
 its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you
 are looking for a programmers's editor, look for another text editor
 or help improve the GTK Text Widget.

Description: Proxy DNS Server
 pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache contents are
 written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope with unreacheable or
 down dns servers (for example in dial-in networking).
 pdnsd can be used with applications that do dns lookups, eg on startup, and
 can't be configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often minute-long
 hangs (or even crashes) that result from stalled dns queries.
 Some Netscape Navigator versions for Unix, for example, expose this behaviour.
 .
 And it's IPv6 capable.

 This is OpusTeX beta-test Version 0.84 (February 1998).  This package
 contains the OpusTeX macros, musixflex, OpusTeX User's Manual in LaTeX
 source and DVI formats, and example source OpusTeX music score files.
 .
 OpusTeX is a set of versatile and power TeX macros to typeset polyphonic,
 orchestral or choral music.  It allows very fine control and produces
 professional printed music scores.
 .
 OpusTeX is still a beta-test Version and only dedicated for those, who
 want to work with and--more important--to work on.
 .
 Due to the important amount of information to be provided to the
 typesetting process, coding OpusTeX might appear to be awfully
 complicated, especially for beginners.  Therefore, it is recommended
 to use OpusTeX with some pre-processors such as ABC2MTeX.
 Visit the GMD Music Archive at http://www.gmd.de/Misc/Music/ and check
 the MuTeX Mailing List Archive for more information.

Description: Debian Linux kernel package build scripts.
 This package provides the capability to create a debian kernel-image
 package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a kernel source
 directory tree.  It can also package the relevant kernel headers into
 a kernel-headers package. In general, this package is very useful if
 you need to create a custom kernel, if, for example, the default
 kernel does not support some of your hardware, or you wish a leaner,
 meaner kernel.  It also scripts the steps that need be taken to
 compile the kernel, which is quite convenient (forgetting a crucial
 step once was the initial motivation for this package). Please look at
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/Rationale.gz for a full list of advantages
 of this package.
 .
 If you are running on an intel x86 platform, and you wish to compile a
 custom kernel (why else are you considering this package?), then you may
 need the package bin86 as well.  (This is not required on other platforms).

Description: Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display
 x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single
 multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays,
 or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the
 other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also
 moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection
 propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically,
 the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension.
 (The servers shipped by Debian support this.)
 .
 x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use
 a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate
 your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might
 be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the
 displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases,
 and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only
 two at a time.

 compression for compressed GIFs, which is covered by a patent held

 Alternatively, you may choose to install the libungif package which
 is available in the main Debian distribution.  The libungif package
 is a variant of giflib with the offending patented LZW compression
 code snipped out, so it can only save uncompressed GIFs.

 nine backends in a sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each
 backend provides one particular core language. For maximum power WML
 additionally ships with a well-suited set of include files which
 provide higher-level features build on top of the backends core
 languages. While not trivial and idiot proof WML provides most of the
 core features real hackers always wanted for HTML generation.

  - File specs allow absolute and relative filenames, symbolic links,
    file replacements and full shell-style globbing.
  - Automatically determines necessary libraries and loaders.
  - Allows stripping of binaries and libraries during copying.
  - Automatically regenerates ld.so.cache
  - Checks for broken symlinks
  - Checks /etc/{fstab,inittab,termcap,pam.conf} for common errors and
    inconsistencies.
  - Checks user directories and files mentioned in /etc/passwd
  - Checks command files (eg, rc.local and .login) and scripts for
    missing binaries and command interpreters.
  - Automatically performs filesystem compression and copying.
  - Can be used with or without LILO.
  - Can make single or double disk sets.
  - Extensive checking of user choices and execution errors.

Description: A redirector for Squid
 Jesred is a very fast and highly configurable redirector for the Squid
 Internet Object Cache. It was derived from Chris Foote's and Wayne
 Piekarski's Squirm 1.0 betaB and some code from Squid itself, but is
 about 2-3x faster than the original version and has some additional
 features.
 .
 Jesred has the following features:
 .
   * uses only a very small amount of memory (a little bit more than
     squirm 1.0 betaB, but still less than perl ;-))
   * able to rewrite GET and optionally ICP_QUERY requests as well
   * one global configuration file
   * one IP access control file which supports CIDR notation only
     (i.e. subnet/mask). Thus only URL requests from the specified
   * subnets/clients are rewritten, if necessary.
   * one rewrite rules configuration file (regular expression matching
     and replacement)
   * optionally logging of common and error messages to a file
   * optionally logging of URL rewrites to a separate log file,
     incl. the number of the rule, which has been used to rewrite the
     URL
   * able to re-read all its configuration files on the fly by sending
     a HUP signal to the process. That's why there is no need to
     restart Squid, if you want to:
       1.change the used log file name[s] (useful for log file rotation)
       2.enable/disable logging
       3.enable/disable debug mode if compiled with DEBUG option
       4.enable/disable URL rewriting of ICP_QUERY (sibling) requests
       5.change the IP access patterns
       6.change the redirect rules
   * If you mess up configuration file[s], Jesred runs in Echo Mode
     (always echos back a newline - i.e. no URL replacement) and squid
     keeps working.

 The objective of this arcade game is to break all the bricks with a ball
 that bounces off the walls and a paddle that you can move. You start by
 firing out the ball from your paddle, which can be moved left and right
 parallel to the wall below it. The ball will move and hit the bricks located
 above, and when it hits a brick it will fall apart (i.e. dissappear), but
 the ball will bounce back to hit other bricks, sidewalls or the highest
 wall. If it falls down not hitting the paddle, you lose one life and have
 to start over.

Description: Picon (Personal Images) database for very high-level domains
 "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into
 databases so that the appropriate image for a given e-mail address can
 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

 rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another.
 rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections
 to the address/port pairs specified in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Since
 rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to
 redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact on the

Description: User binaries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains user binaries for libgsm, an implementation of the European
 GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding,
 prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long
 term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: A wrapper generator for matrix languages
 Matwrap is a tool for interfacing C++ code into matrix-oriented scripting
 languages such as Octave, Tela or Matlab 5
 .
 It generates all the code to convert from the scripting language's internal
 types into the types that your C++ code understands (e.g., double, char *,
 float *, struct abc *). You do not need to understand any of the API details of
 the language to use your C++ code; just give matwrap a .h file describing
 your functions.
 .
 Brief list of features:
 .
  - Functions are automatically vectorized.
  - Arguments containing dimensions of other vector and matrix arguments can
    be computed automatically and need  not be specified.
  - Pointers to structures and classes are supported. Public member functions
    of classes may be called, and public data members may be evaluated or
    set. Inheritance is supported.

 Kimwitu (pronounced kee'mweetoo) is a system that supports
 the construction of programs that use trees or terms as
 their main data structure. It is a `meta-tool' in the
 development process of tools.
 .
 It can easily be interfaced with Yacc and Lex - the idea
 is that yacc and lex are used to do the parsing, and
 Kimwitu routines are used to built and manipulate the
 parse tree.
 .
 There is also Kimwitu++ (also packaged for Debian) which interfaces
 with C++ instead of C.

Description: An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents.
 PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  It contains a
 simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. (The most popular
 nowadays are the HTML DTD's. This package turns your emacs into the
 one of most powerful HTML editors and will be ultimately flexible as
 well, since you could upgrade your editor by just installing new
 DTD's). Functions provided includes menus and commands for inserting
 tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of
 structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window
 with information about types and defaults, and structure based
 editing.
 .
 Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do
 need to have the DTD's installed in order to use psgml. Since psgml
 installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data. Some
 other packages which also provide SGML DTD's are suggested, like
 debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".
 .
 This is a standard package for XEmacs.

 Sfio is a portable library for managing I/O streams. It provides similar
 functionality to the ANSI C Standard I/O functions known collectively as
 Stdio. However, it has a distinct interface and is generally faster and
 more robust than most Stdio implementations. Sfio also introduces a number
 of new features and concepts beyond Stdio stream I/O processing:
 .
  * Automatic locking to avoid concurrent stream accesses,
  * I/O disciplines to pre/post-process read/write data from/to streams,
  * Stream stacking for recursive processing of nested streams,
  * Stream pooling for automatic stream synchronization when I/O operations
    are performed on different streams,
  * Buffer reservation for safe access to the internal buffers of streams,
  * Robust handling of variable-sized records, and
  * Extensible printf/scanf-like formatting I/O operations.

    * Code-to-HTML converter giving only details of your interface
      and pre/postconditions (similar to Eiffel short form).
    * Statement and function-level tracing under GDB.
    * Logging via inline C code (as in <asser.h>) or by extraction of
      commands for gdb which results in no performance cost
      unless running in the debugger.
 .
 It was written by the author because he has written too many of these
 systems in the past for individual projects and has finally gotten tired
 of it.

MD5sum: 8fed07704b373a96bccf9a1542e18180
Description: Verify electronic mail addresses.
 'vrfy' is a tool to verify e-mail addresses and mailing lists.  In its
 simplest form it takes an address "user@domain", figures out the MX hosts
 for "domain", and issues the SMTP command VRFY at the primary MX host
 (optionally all), or at "domain" itself if no MX hosts exist.  Without
 "domain" it goes to "localhost".
 .
 More complex capabilities are:
  * recursively expanding forward files or mailing lists,
  * detecting mail forwarding loops,
  * understanding full-blown RFC822 address specifications,
  * syntax checking that can be carried out either locally or remotely,
  * various options provided to exploit alternative protocol suites
    if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose output.
 .
 Obvious limitations exist (mostly due to a lousy VRFY command
 implementation on some hosts), but otherwise, it works pretty well.

 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 The fonts from this package are not designed for big monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).  You can find big fonts in
 the package xfonts-cronyx-isocyr-100dpi.
 .
 The fonts are modified (mainly with Cyrillics added) versions of the
 most important X-Window fonts from 75dpi/.  Unfortunately Lucida is
 a regustered trademark, so these fonts use the name Serene inplace
 of Lucida.

Description: Full screen ncurses traceroute tool
 mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
 in a single network diagnostic tool.
 As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
 mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
 determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.
 mtr-tiny is compiled without support for X and conserves disk space.

Description: 100 dpi KOI8-R encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 100 dots
 per inch.  The encoding of these fonts is KOI8-R.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-koi8r-75dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-koi8r-100dpi may be
 more suitable for large monitors and/or large screen resolutions
 (over 1024x768).
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.  Xcyr has all Slavic Cyrillic letters and includes many other
 symbols.

 VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read

 expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
 messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other
 more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
 digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
 according to various criteria.
 .
 It should also be mentioned here that the documentation for vm is woefully
 behind the times; there fore we include /usr/doc/vm/vm-vars.el.gz, which
 has information about all customizable variables in vm. Also, VM 6.x
 versions have problems with the library tm-vm from the Tiny Mime (TM)
 package, since that version was written for VM 5.X. Indeed, the problems
 seems to exist with to exist with semi as well.

Description: A highway trip planner
 This is a highway trip planning program, similar to programs like
 Rand McNally's "TripMaker."  It allows you to plan road trips between
 two or more locations, using various interchangeable map files (or
 databases).
 .
 Currently, the program includes two databases covering North America;
 one is fairly simplistic, and one is quite detailed.  You can also
 create new databases with the included editor.
 .
 For retrocomputing nuts, this program traces its lineage back to a
 1980s program called "RoadRoute" written by Jim Butterfield for the
 Amiga.  AFAIK all of the code has been rewritten, but the Basic-USA
 database included here is Jim's original dataset.
 .

 interface and the editor, install routeplanner-gnome as well.

Description: Control the behaviour of your cdrom device
 This program allows you to control the behaviour of your Linux cdrom
 player.  You'll need a cdrom device that complies to the new interface
 defined in linux/Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex.  For
 kernel 2.0 this is only the cm206 drive, for kernel 2.1 this
 includes IDE and SCSI drives.
 .
 You can control: auto close, auto eject, medium type checking and
 tray locking.  You can get information on the volume name of cdroms
 and other data, and you can set the speed of your drive and choose a
 disc from a jukebox.
 .
 In order to fully exploit the possibilities, you'll need libc6 and a
 recent version of the the linux kernel, but you will get decent error
 behaviour in return.  Expect a message "No medium found" if you
 attempt to mount an empty drive or "Wrong medium type" if you try to
 mount an audio disc, instead of a whole load of kernel error
 messages.
 .
 The source of this package may be an example for cdrom player program
 developers that wish to exploit the features of the new cdrom
 interface.

 investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without
 computing an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content of
 a sequence alignment.

     dict-hitchcock - Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary
     dict-gazetteer - Database of Geographic Data from the U.S. Census
 .
 These packages are discussed in more detail in the file
 /usr/doc/dictd/README.Debian.gz
 Either dict-web1913 or dict-wn is essential for a useful
 dictionary server.  It is strongly recommended that both be installed.
 It is desirable that either dict-jargon or dict-foldoc, or both of
 them, be installed.
 .
 The client program, dict, is packaged in dict*.deb  If you are
 running a server, you will want the client for all machines in your
 network, and for testing server operations.

MD5sum: 2a9482a632fcfb5ccca9c6bb576d31b4
Description: Builtin kernel debugger.
 This package contains a patch to the Linux kernel, which provides a
 means of examining kernel memory and data structures while the system
 is operational.
 .
 Only i386 and ia64 are supported for now.
 .
 Additional commands may be easily added to format and display
 essential system data structures given an identifier or address of the
 data structure.
 .
 Current command set allows complete control of kernel operations
 including single-stepping a processor, stopping upon execution of a
 specific instruction, stopping upon access (or modification) of a
 specific virtual memory location, stopping upon access to a register
 in the input-output address space, stack tracebacks for the current
 active task as well as for all other tasks (by process id),
 instruction disassembly, et. al.
 .
 Officially supported kernel version for kdb 1.8 is 2.4.2,
 but versions close enough may (or may not)
 work.  Please look at /use/share/doc/kernel-patch-kdb/README.Debian
 for more info.
 .
 Also provided are kdb-v1.5-2.2.18 and kdb-v1.7-2.4.0 for i386, and
 kdb-v1.7-2.4.1-ia64-010131.
 .
 The BFD headers from the binutils-dev package are required to compile
 a kdb-enabled kernel.
 .
 Version 6.23 of the kernel-package package has a bug preventing correct
 application of this patch.

 to remove capabilities from your Linux kernel.
 .
 For example, you can remove the capability to load kernel modules by executing
 'lcap CAP_SYS_MODULE' as root. Then no one, not even root, can load modules
 into your kernel. This can be useful for tightening the security of your
 Linux machines.

Description: Streaming Mpeg Layer III server
 Icecast is an Internet based broadcasting system based on the Mpeg
 Layer III streaming technology.  It was originally inspired by
 Nullsoft's Shoutcast and also mp3serv by Scott Manley.  The icecast
 project was started for several reasons: a) all broadcasting systems
 were pretty much closed source, non-free software implementations, b)
 Shoutcast doesn't allow you to run your own directory servers, or
 support them, and c) we thought it would be a lot of fun.
 .
 Icecast is almost completely Shoutcast compatible as far as we've
 been able to determine.  WinAmp can both send encoded streams as well
 as stream music from icecast.  Icecast can also use the
 yp.shoutcast.com directory services and adds the ability to use other
 directory services.

Description: Tool to create,maintain and display Yahoo! like directories.
 Catalog is a perl program that allows to create, maintain and display
 Yahoo! like directories. The user interface is 100% HTML. It requires a
 MySQL database to run.
 .
 The general idea behind the design of Catalog is that creating a catalog
 is mainly a matter of organizing objects in a structured tree. For
 Catalog the objects are records in a table of the SQL database.
 The structured tree is a set of tree nodes and relations between these
 nodes. The maintainer of the catalog is in charge of building the tree
 and placing objects in this tree.
 .
 Here is a short list of the functions provided by Catalog:
 .
  * Display structured trees of resources.
  * Display chronologically ordered resources and associated calendar.
  * Display alphabetical indexes of resources.
  * Allow full text search in the resources and the category names.
  * Powerful HTML based administration of catalogs.
  * On-Line editing of resource records.
  * Handle an arbitrary number of catalogs.
  * High performances using mod_perl and Apache.
  * Easy customization of the user view using HTML template files.
  * It is possible to define more than one view of the same catalog.
  * Load and unload a thematic catalog in XML.
  * Create an HTML dump of a structured tree to publish a static version.
  * Complete documentation including a guide and a reference manual.
  * Ready to use example.

Description: Perl module for exchanging XML messages between DBI data sources
 This module maintains simple XML templates that describe object
 structure.  The module is capable of generating SQL statements based
 on these templates and executing them against DBI data sources. After
 executing the SQL, the package formats the data results into XML
 strings. E.g. the following simple template
 .
     <TEMPLATE NAME='SysLogins' TYPE='XML' VERSION='1.0'
     TABLE='syslogins'
         ACTION='SAVE'>
     <KEY NAME='suid' DATATYPE='NUMERIC' PARENT_NAME='OBJECT_ID' />
     <COLUMN NAME='LoginId' EXPR='suid' DATATYPE='NUMERIC' />
     </TEMPLATE>
 .
 being executed with key value = 1, will be tranlated into this SQL:
 .
 SELECT suid LoginId FROM syslogins where suid = 1
 .
 and the result will be formatted into this XML string:
 .
     <SysLogins>
         <LoginId>1<LoginId>
     </SysLogins>
 .
 Inbound messages can be processed according to the same kind of
 templates and the database is updated accordingly. Templates are
 capable of defining the SQL operators, plus new SAVE operation which
 is basically a combination of SELECT and either INSERT or UPDATE
 depending on whether the record was found by the compound key value
 or not.

 Alternatively, you can process any array instead of @ARGV which is
 used by default and mentioned mostly in this manual.

 The interpolated @ARGV could be subsequently processed by the usual
 option handling, e.g. by a Getopt::xxx module.  Getopt::ArgvFile does
 not perform any option handling itself, it only prepares the array
 @ARGV.

Description: Undelete files on ext2 partitions
 Recover automates some steps as described in the ext2-undeletion
 howto. This means it seeks all the deleted inodes on your hard drive
 with debugfs. When all the inodes are indexed, recover asks you some
 questions about the deleted file. These questions are:
   * Hard disk device name
   * Year of deletion
   * Month of deletion
   * Weekday of deletion
   * First/Last possible day of month
   * Min/Max possible file size
   * Min/Max possible deletion hour
   * Min/Max possible deletion minute
   * User ID of the deleted file
   * A text string the file included (can be ignored)
 .
 If recover found any fitting inodes, it asks to give a directory name
 and dumps the inodes into the directory. Finally it asks you if you
 want to filter the inodes again (in case you typed some wrong
 answers).

Description: 100 dpi KOI8-U encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 100 dots
 per inch.  The encoding of these fonts is KOI8-U.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-koi8u-75dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-koi8u-100dpi may be
 more suitable for large monitors and/or large screen resolutions
 (over 1024x768).
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.  Xcyr has all Slavic Cyrillic letters and includes many other
 symbols.

 manager, or any other textual code). This transformation is coded in
 modules, where the programmer tells which elements are to be shown (a
 checkbutton, listbox, etc.) and gives some help on each element.
 .
 With this release, modules exist for configuring bash, fvwm1, fvwm2,
 tcsh, elm, rtin, ipfwadm, procmail and canna, and they can be found in
 separate packages named dotfile-<program>.

 hostname, and 2 the web cgi that is used as the administration tool and as
 the users tool to manage their own account. Using the web cgi a user can set
 their desired homepage in their settings and then set the special URL as the
 default page for their browser so now every time they open their browser
 their hostname will be automatically be updated without having to run any
 other sort of client application and then they would be redirected to the
 URL they set in their GnuDIP settings.

 a number of different gui bindings, Tk being the most common so that
 is what is included here.  Scheme is designed for educational

Description: development environment for mifluz
 The purpose of mifluz is to provide a C++ library to build and query a full
 text inverted index. It is dynamically updatable, scalable (up to 1Tb
 indexes), uses a controlled amount of memory, shares index files and memory
 cache among processes or threads and compresses index files to 50% of the raw
 data. The structure of the index is configurable at runtime and allows
 inclusion of relevance ranking information. The query functions do not require
 to load all the occurences of a searched term. They consume very few resources
 and many searches can be run in parallel.

Description: a more/less paging type program
 Most is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the
 contents of a file on a terminal. It pauses after each windowful and
 prints on the window status line of the screen the file name, current
 line number, and the percentage of the file so far displayed.
 .
 Unlike other paging programs, most is capable of displaying an
 arbitrary number of windows as long as each window occupies at least
 two screen lines. Each window may contain the same file or a different
 file. In addition, each window has its own mode.
 .
 In addition to displaying ordinary text files, most can also display
 binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.

 ftff searches the directory tree. This is a case in-sensitive and fault
 tolerant way of 'find . -name xxxx -print'.

  "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into
 databases so that the appropriate image for a given e-mail address can
 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

Description: A program documentation tool.
 The idea is to include for every function or procedure a standard header
 containing all sorts of information about the procedure or function.
 ROBODoc extracts these headers from the source file and puts them in a
 separate autodocs-file.  ROBODoc thus allows you to include the program
 documentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two
 separate documents.  Or as Petteri puts it: "robodoc is very useful -
 especially for programmers who don't like writing documents with Word or
 some other strange tool."
 .
 ROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats:
 HTML, ASCII, AmigaGuide, LaTeX, or RTF. In HTML mode it can
 generate cross links between headers. You can even include parts
 of your source code.
 .
 ROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C,
 Pascal, Shell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript,
 Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++, Java -- basically any program in which you
 can use remarks/comments.

Description: 100 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-100dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per inch.  In

 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-100dpi may be more suitable for large monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories for
 use by an X server or X font server.

Description: A versatile News and mailing list reader for Emacsen
 Gnus is a message-reading laboratory.  This is by far the most
 powerful and extensible news reader that I am aware of. It will let
 you look at just  about anything as if it were a newsgroup.  You can
 read mail with it,  you can browse directories with it, you can ftp
 with it---you can even read news with it! It handles single file
 groups, MH format folders, mbox files, digests, knows about POP,
 etc. It can split incoming mail ala procmail.
 .
 This version of gnus handles MIME natively. It adds offline reading
 capability with gnus-agent. It is not compatible with older versions
 of TM (since a large number of hooks and variables have changed to
 allow that). NOTE: Please do not use tm-gnus with  this version.
 .
 Instead of boring old KILL files, it has an adaptive multifaceted
 scoring mechanism -- you add or reduce the score of the article based
 on rules, and a component of the score comes in from your past
 behaviour -- for example, articles similar to ones you read and saved
 get higher scores. This adaptive mechanism is one of the most
 interesting part of Gnus.
 .
 Gnus tries to empower people who read news the same way Emacs
 empowers people who edit text.  Gnus sets no limits to what the user
 should be allowed to do.  Users are encouraged to extend Gnus to make
 it behave like they want it to behave.  A program should not control
 people; people should be empowered to do what they want by using (or
 abusing) the program.
 .
 Gnus comes by default with XEmacs, but this is a stand alone package
 that replaces the stock Gnusii. A note for people  using the nnimap
 backend: SSL support requires w3-el-e20; and even otherwise w3-el
 makes following hyperlinks in mail and news easier.

MD5sum: 28262f1468f8436f07ba2d5a216a28d8
Description: Debian package scripts for CVS source trees.
 This package provides the capability to inject or import Debian
 source packages into a CVS repository, build a Debian package from
 the CVS repository, and helps in integrating upstream changes into
 the repository.
 .
 The import or inject process takes a dsc (Debian source control)
 file, and imports it into CVS. The module path can maintains
 distribution and section information; for example, one may inject
 hemm/hemm/devel/make into the repository.
 .
 The build process works analogously to dpkg-buildpackage, and can be
 used from within the checked out source tree, or with additional
 information, can be used from anywhere. In the latter case, you can
 build any previous version of the package, as long as the
 corresponding orig.tar.gz file is still around. The build script
 checks out the relevant version from the CVS repository, and runs
 dpkg-buildpackage to create the Debian package.
 .
 Combined, these utilities provide an infrastructure to facilitate the
 use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate
 CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and possibly
 experimental distributions, along with the other benefits of a
 version control system.
 .
 This can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example.

 This module provides an object that matches a data source
 against a query expression.
 .
 Query expressions are compiled into an internal form when a new
 object is created or the `prepare' method is called; they are
 not recompiled on each match.
 .
 The class provided by this module uses four packages to process
 the query. The query parser parses the question and calls a
 query expression builder (internal form of the question). The
 optimizer is then called to reduce the complexity of the
 expression. The solver applies the expression on a data source.

MD5sum: e8ca1760e77b6e9c479ea8fdacdf42f8
Description: A Perl replacement for Make
 Excerpted from the README file:
 .
 Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is quite
 different from previous software construction systems. Cons was
 designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction of
 software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it easy
 to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and
 maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and
 accurately reproducible.
 .
 Cons uses a number of techniques to accomplish all of this.
 Construction scripts are just Perl scripts, making them both easy to
 comprehend and very flexible. Global scoping of variables is replaced
 with an import/export mechanism for sharing information between
 scripts, significantly improving the readability and maintainability
 of each script. Construction environments are introduced: these are
 Perl objects that capture the information required for controlling the
 build process. Multiple environments are used when different semantics
 are required for generating products in the build tree. Cons
 implements automatic dependency analysis and uses this to globally
 sequence the entire build. Variant builds are easily produced from a
 single source tree. Intelligent build subsetting is possible, when
 working on localized changes. Overrides can be setup to easily
 override build instructions without modifying any scripts. MD5
 cryptographic signatures are associated with derived files, and are
 used to accurately determine whether a given file needs to be rebuilt.

 This is a button that appears on your screen when you log into xdm.
 When you press it, it logs you out of the session.
 .
 You need to have a file called .xsession in your home dir that starts
 the logout button in the foreground and your window manager in the
 background. By putting other things in this file, you can do things
 like change your background to your favorite image, start a clock and/or
 a terminal window, or even add a rotating earth or fish tank! You can start
 any number of programs as long as you background them.
 .
 An example of .xsession is in /usr/doc/logout-button/examples and if you
 edit it choosing your favorite window manager, it will try to find and
 use it. Remember to place it in ~you/.xsession and make it executable.
 If you don't edit it, it will try to find and use the fvwm2 window mgr.
 .
 X infrastructure has a mechanism which waits for some program to exit
 indicating the user wishes to end his X session. logout-button is
 the simplest form of such a "session manager".
 .
 The example .xsession file provided in the doc/examples directory
 picks a window manager to run, starts it in the background, optionally
 starts other clients (xterm, xearth, xfishtank) also in the background
 and finally starts the session manager (logout-button) in the foreground,
 replacing the process and process ID belonging to the shell interpreting
 the .xsession. Because the infrastructure of X is waiting for this process
 to exit, when logout-button is pushed, the session is ended.

 The use of ntpdate is optional if you're running the ntp package, it can help
 a system obtain lock if it starts with a time that's pretty close by using
 ntpdate before starting the daemon.

Description: eXode database manager
 The eXode database manager is a structured ASCII-based database library.
 EXdbm can be used to manage the configuration files of eXode clients.
 .
 The library uses a tree of hash tables structures stored in memory, favouring
 speed upon memory consumption. This is not a general purpose database library,
 its efficiency is based on the fact that the databases managed contain less
 than a few thousand entries.
 .
 Note that eXdbm is a general purpose configuration library, it can be used in
 many other applications without relations to the eXode project.
 .

 This package can replace the usual svgalib1 package, on which many
 other packages depend. Unfortunately, the proper svgalib1 requires
 some configuration and is a bit verbose, so if you don't need console
 graphics at all, and would install it only to satisfy dependencies,
 this dummy package may be an alternative for you.
 .
 This package can also be used on architectures where the real
 svgalib1 hasn't been ported to (e.g. m68k).
 .
 It also provides the few headers from the -dev package and should be
 usable as a development environment.

 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 100 dots
 per inch.  The encoding of these fonts is CP1251 (microsoft-1251).
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-cp1251-75dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-cp1251-100dpi may be
 more suitable for large monitors and/or large screen resolutions
 (over 1024x768).
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.  Xcyr has all Slavic Cyrillic letters and includes many other
 symbols.

 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).  Less uses
 termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

 Provides routines that can be plugged in to replace malloc(),

 .
 If you're not debugging, and an allocation fails, FDA will call user
 supplied callbacks to allow you to free up some memory or shut down
 the program cleanly -- this means you don't have to check the
 return values from malloc if you don't want to.
 .
 For debugging FDA provides a nice toolkit for validating pointers,
 checking for leaks, gathering memory statistics, bounds checking and
 other nice things.  FDA uses shredding, prefix and postfix signatures,
 and a liberal amount of predicate asserts.

 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

 your opponents' trails, and even your own trail.
 .
 Several modes of play are available, including "get-all-the-bonuses",
 deathmatch, and "squish-the-pedestrians".  One or two player (split-screen)
 play is available on all graphics targets supported by GGI.
 .
 You should install the heroes-sound-effects package if you want sound effects,
 and the heroes-sound-tracks package if you want background music in the game.
 These packages are quite large (especially heroes-sound-tracks), so you might
 want to try the game out before installing them.

Description: Tcl/Tk client for the AOL Instant Messenger service
 From the TiK homepage (http://www.aim.aol.com/tik/):
 .
 TiK is a pure Tcl/Tk 8.1 version of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). The TiK
 client began its life as a scaled down version of the native Windows and
 Macintosh clients. However, TiK now has most of the features the native
 clients have, plus some extras. TiK includes a graphical buddy list display
 plus packages for away messages, buddy pounce, buddy ticker, and im
 capturing. It is very easy for end users to add new features to TiK, using
 Tcl/Tk. TiK is meant to give UNIX users an alternative to the Java client.
 .
 This release of TiK requires Tcl/Tk 8.1 or greater, unlike the previous
 releases, which only required 8.0 or greater.

Description: A concurrent multi-player battle strategy game.
 xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
 strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
 scenarios.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

Description: Programming environment and editor for console and X11
 Xwpe is an integrated programming and debugging environment similar to
 Borland's Turbo C and Pascal family. It has many features including
 the ability to start many compilers, linkers and debuggers from a
 menu-based interface or using keystrokes.
 .
 Syntax highlighting is included for many programming languages, and
 any compiler and debugger can easily be used by the program. When
 compiling from within xwpe, errors in the source code can be jumped to
 and swiftly corrected. Variables and the stack can be easily displayed.
 Setting and unsetting breakpoints can be done directly within the
 source code.
 .
 Although it is designed to be a tool for programmers (when invoked as
 wpe or xwpe), it can also be used as an easy to learn text editor
 (when invoked as we or xwe).

 Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and tools to
 process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document in a
 pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. yodl2html) to convert it to some
 final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, ms, man, LaTeX
 SGML and texinfo, plus a poor-man's text converter.  Main document types are
 "article", "report", "book" and "manpage".  The Yodl document language is
 designed to be easy to use and extensible.

Description: Pascal to C translator
 P2c is a tool for translating Pascal programs into C. The input
 consists of a set of source files in any of the following Pascal
 dialects: HP Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC VAX Pascal, Oregon Software
 Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal,
 Texas Instruments Pascal, Apollo Domain Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is also
 supported.
 .
 Output is a set of .c and .h files that comprise an equivalent program
 in any of several dialects of C. Output code may be kept machine and
 dialect-independent, or it may be targeted to a specific machine and
 compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are converted into fully
 functional C which will compile and run with no further modifications,
 although p2c sometimes chooses to generate readable code at the expense
 of absolute generality.

 used transparently. Libsafe intercepts calls to functions known as
 vulnerable, libsafe uses a substitute version of the function that
 implements the same functionality, but makes sure any buffer overflows are
 contained within the current stack frame.

 .
 If you plan on doing development with libXg, you'll probably want to
 have a copy of sam installed (for the file format man pages) or a copy
 of sam's source (which, of course, also has example code).

Description: Jigsaw, An Interactive History by Graham Nelson
 New Year's Eve, 1999, a quarter to midnight and where else to be but
 Century Park! Fireworks cascade across the sky, your stomach rumbles
 uneasily, music and lasers howl across the parkland... Not exactly your
 ideal party (especially as that rather attractive stranger in black
 has slipped back into the crowds) - but cheer up, you won't live to
 see the next.
 .
 "Jigsaw" begins at the very end of the Twentieth Century, but the action
 ranges over the past hundred years, covering the most critical historical
 moments of the period: from assassinations to world war, from pop music
 to the space race.  But throughout it all, just WHO is Black?
 .
 You'll need a Z-code (i.e. Infocom-format) game interpreter, such as
 XZip or Frotz, to run this game.

Description: Conservative garbage collector for C (development)
 Boehm's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc.
 This package is required to compile and link programs that use
 libgc5.
 .
 Since the collector does not require pointers to be tagged, it does
 not attempt to ensure that all inaccessible storage is reclaimed.
 However it has typically been more successful at reclaiming unused
 memory than most C programs using explicit deallocation.  Unlike
 manually introduced leaks, the amount of unreclaimed memory typically
 stays bounded.

 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This also possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.1.0.0.

Description: shared library for GIF images (development files)
 This package contains header files needed to compile programs that use
 giflib.
 .
 The Graphics Interchange Format(c) specification is the copyrighted
 property of CompuServe Incorporated.  Unfortunately, it used LZW
 compression for compressed GIFs, which is covered by a patent held
 by Unisys.  As this package existed before UniSys's lawyeritis attack
 of New Years' Day 1995, it is grandfathered in under their license
 terms and you do not have to pay fees for using it.
 .
 Alternatively, you may choose to install the libungif package which
 is available in the main Debian distribution.  The libungif package
 is a variant of giflib with the offending patented LZW compression
 code snipped out, so it can only save uncompressed GIFs.

 delivers them to another.  It requires at least read-only permissions
 on the remote server, and needs to have peer permissions on the local
 server.  It works well with INN, but should also work with any other
 RFC977 compliant news software.  Newsflash's highly parallel design
 is optimized for throughput, which makes quite a difference to INN's
 nntpget and the like.

MD5sum: 9bbd3a6140b31c104130fa1ace8a521d
Description: Convert JPEG compressed images to PostScript Level 2
 jpeg2ps converts JPEG files to PostScript Level 2 or 3 EPS. In fact, jpeg2ps
 is not really a converter but a "wrapper": it reads the image parameters
 (width, height, number of color components) in a JPEG file, writes the
 according EPS header and then copies the compressed JPEG data to the output
 file. Decompression is done by the PostScript interpreter (only PostScript
 Level 2 and 3 interpreters support JPEG compression and decompression).
 If you have a slow communication channel and a fast printer, sending
 compressed image data is a big win.

Description: Decodes transfer encoded text type mime messages.
 This program performs the decoding of transfer encoded text type
 mime messages.  The message in its entirety is read from stdin.
 The decoded message is written to stdout; hence, this program
 behaves as a filter which may be placed wherever convenient.
 .
 It is assumed that the message has reached its point of final
 delivery and at that point 8-bit text types can be handled
 natively.  Hence, the need for transfer-encodings is not present
 any more.
 .
 Only some cases are handled:
  - encoded header fields are decoded from QP or B encoding.
  - The charset is assumed to be iso-8859-1
  - part or subparts of content-type text only are decoded
  - all other content-types are passed transparently.

   'duration<180', 'genre=pop', 'john=good|fred=unheard' etc.)
   - Built-in telnet client (see manual).
   - Library interface, no need to write TCP code.
   - Comes with command line shell program for interfacing and web client to
   this shell program for web-based control.

 ff, rw) plus some additions: mark, which places a marker at the
 current position of the head, and export, which saves the audio data
 between the mark and the current head position to a file you specify
 in wav, cdr (cd mastering), or raw data format.

Description: Yorick interpreted language and scientific graphics
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The language features a compact syntax for many common array
 operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
 efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
 variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
 similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
 typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
 later use.
 .
 This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
 you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.

 As these files can be used by all MIME compliant programs, they
 have been moved into their own package that others can depend upon.
 .
 Other packages add themselves as viewers/editors/composers/etc by
 using the provided "update-mime" program.
 .
 In addition, the commands "see", "edit", "compose", and "print"
 will display, alter, create, and print (respectively) any file using
 a program determined from the entries in the mime.types and mailcap
 files.

 Dump examines files on a filesystem and determines which files need to be
 backed up.  These files are copied to the given disk, tape or other storage
 medium for safe keeping.
 .
 The restore command performs the inverse function of dump.  A full backup of
 a file system may be restored and subsequent incremental backups layered on
 top of it.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or
 partial backups.

Description: Alternative one-configfile boot mechanism
 This package provides an alternative mechanism to boot the system, to
 shut it down and to change runlevels.  The /etc/rc?.d/* links will be
 converted into one single configuration file /etc/runlevel.conf
 instead, which is easier to administrate than symlinks, and is also
 more flexible.
 .
 The package will automatically convert your existing symlinks into
 the file method on installation, and convert the file back into
 symlinks on removal.  Both mechanisms are compatible trough
 /etc/init.d/rc, /etc/init.d/rcS and /usr/sbin/update-rc.d scripts.

 Replacement for sysklogd.
 .
 Contains the syslogd daemon that gathers messages from various
 sources and routes them according to it's configuration. The
 code for input and output is entirely in modules, this makes
 it incredibly flexible and extensible.
 .
 It is part of Core-SDI's Advanced Logging and Auditing Techniques
 suite: http://www.core-sdi.com/english/products.html
 .
 Included input modules are:
  * im_unix: old syslog's local method.
  * im_linux: read kernel log messages.
  * im_udp: old syslog's remote method.
  * im_tcp: TCP remote logging.
 .
 Included output modules are:
  * om_classic: logging to files, programs, terminals (users) or
    UDP (network, for im_udp). Ie everything old syslog did.
  * om_tcp: TCP remote logging.
  * om_peo: cryptographically protects your logfiles so you know
    if somebody manipulated them even if the intruder became root.
  * om_regex: Filtering of messages by regular expressions.
  * om_mysql: Logging to a remote MySQL database (needs libmysqlclient10).
  * om_pgsql: Logging to a remote PostgreSQL database (needs libpgsql2.1).

Description: Web Based IMAP Mail Program.
 A set of PHP3 scripts that implement an IMAP based webmail
 system. Assuming you have an account on a server that supports
 IMAP, you can theoretically use an installation of IMP to check your
 mail from anywhere that you have web access.
 .
 IMP does not require an IMAP server to be running on the machine you
 install it on unless you are intending to have it use the current machine
 for it's IMAP connections. (If you are connecting to a remote server
 for your mail than you don't need IMAP)
 .
 IMP requires a database to be running if you want to use the extended
 features such as the addressbook, and prefs.  It currently uses PHPLib
 for the database interface so as long as PHPLib supports your database of
 choice your good to go.  This package is designed to support
 PostgreSQL and MySQL directly.

Description: A collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs.
 t1utils is a collection of simple type-1 font manipulation programs.
 Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.
 .
 This version of the t1utils programs has been maintained by Eddie
 Kohler <eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu> since version 1.5, based on the
 original code by I. Lee Hetherington.  As such, it is a complete
 replacement for the t1utils Debian package, which is based on version
 1.2 of I. Lee Hetherington's code.

 ferm allows one to reduce the tedious task of carefully inserting

 .
 ferm supports ipchains firewalls, ipfwadm rules and
 iptables firewalls. Changing to another system will be
 very easy, and ferm will help in the process.
 .
 ferm compiles ready to go firewall-rules from a structured rule-
 setup. These rules will be executed by the preferred kernel
 interface, such as ipchains(8) and iptables(8).
 .
 ferm will also add in modularizing firewalls, because it creates
 the possibility to split up the firewall into several different
 files, which can be reloaded at will, so you can dynamically
 adjust your rules.
 .
 ferm, pronounced "firm", stands for "For Easy Rule Making".

Description: A Fortran77 to C/C++ translator, plus static & shared libs.
 f2c translates Fortran77 (with some extensions) into C, so that it can
 then be compiled and run on a system with no Fortran compiler.  The C
 files must then be linked against the appropriate libraries.
 .
 Currently this is more stable than g77, and is the recommended way
 to compile Fortran as black box routines.  However source level
 debugging facilities are not available.

 If you want to avoid packages that remote users can use to compromise the
 system you should look at the harden-remoteflaws instead.

 NOTE! This package will not make your system uncrackable, and it is
 not intended to do so. Making your system secure involves a LOT

Description: Program to support the "wheel" on some new mice
 Various new mice, including the Microsoft IntelliMouse, and the
 Logitech MouseMan+, Wheel Mouse, and others, now have a "wheel"
 button in the middle of them. This wheel button acts both as a
 standard button (by pressing it), and a wheel, which under MS
 Windows may be used for scrolling windows around.
 .
 This program supports the wheel scrolling operation by one of
 two means:
 1. Some newer X servers support mapping the wheel to buttons
    4 and 5, which imwheel then captures and supports,
 2. Using a patched version of gpm, the normal mouse events are
    passed on to the X server through /dev/gpmdata (gpm's standard
    "repeater" mode), and in addition wheel events are sent to another
    pipe, /dev/gpmwheel. imwheel picks up these events, and translates
    them.

Description: Keeps FTP archives up-to-date
 Mirror uses the FTP protocol to locally duplicate remote host files and
 directories selected with Perl regular expressions.  By default transfers
 only files missing locally or whose remote sizes or time-stamps have changed.
 Can reduce directory download using compressed listings in ls-lR.gz files
 or further using compressed differences of daily listings in ls-lR.patch.gz
 files.  Amongst many flexible options it can gzip and split files.  Tracks
 large distant FTP archives accurately with low download volume. Simpler
 programs like "mirrordir" use less memory and may copy directory trees
 faster between local machines.

 The masqdialer system is designed to provide easily accessible control
 of multiple dialout modem connections to the members of a LAN using IP
 Masquerade for their internet connectivity. The system is a
 client/server design, so as long as a client can be written for a
 particular platform, that platform can take advantage of masqdialer's
 offerings. The masqdialer daemon runs on the linux machine, and upon an
 authorized client request, carries out the user's request.

Description: Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (BGP4+/BGP/RIPng/RIP2)
 MRT is a set of Routing and Network Performance measurement tools, with
 BGP4+/BGP/RIPng/RIP2 routing software (now includes DVMRP and PIM-DM)
 .
 MRT uses novel approaches to routing architecture design, and
 incorporates features such as parallel lightweight processes, multiple
 processor support, and shared memory. The object-oriented, modular
 design of the software encourages the rapid addition and prototyping
 of experimental routing protocol and inter-domain policy algorithms.
 .
 You can use MRT applications and libraries to:
   * Serve as the backbone routing software for your IPv6 or IPv4
     network connection.
   * Simultaneously handle tasks such as routing policy communication,
     routing policy calculation, and maintenance of a RIB, and
     distribute these tasks over multiple processors or multiple
     machines
   * Generate and analyze route flap statistics
   * Generate real-time graphical maps of Internet routing
   * Capture a BGP peering session and monitor it in real time
   * Record and replay sequences of events, such as routing failures

 The perl-ldap distribution has several advantages:
  * By using the perl object interface the perl-ldap modules
    provide programmers with an interface which allows complex
    searches of LDAP directories with only a small amount of code.
  * All the perl-ldap modules are written entirely in perl, which
    means that the library is truly cross-platform compatible.
    No C or XS extension are used so no C compiler is needed to
    install the modules.

 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.

 The Remembrance Agent is one of the projects being developed by the MIT
 Media Lab's software agents group.  Given a collection of the user's
 accumulated email, usenet news articles, papers, saved HTML files and other
 text notes, it attempts to find those documents which are most relevant to
 the user's current context.  That is, it searches this collection of text
 for the documents which bear the highest word-for-word similarity to the
 text the user is currently editing, in the hope that they will also bear
 high conceptual similarity and thus be useful to the user's current work.
 These suggestions are continuously displayed in a small buffer at the
 bottom of the user's emacs buffer.  If a suggestion looks useful, the full
 text can be retrieved with a single command.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep.
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: The GNU Parted disk partitioning library, shared libraries.
 The GNU Parted library is a disk partitioning and partition
 resizing library. It contains an API which allows you to
 create, destroy, resize, move and copy hard disk partitions.
 This package contains shared libraries used by Parted.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD and PC98
 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk)
 type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems supported are
 ext2, fat (FAT16 and FAT32) and linux-swap. Parted can also
 detect hfs (Mac OS), ntfs, reiserfs and ufs filesystems, but
 cannot create/remove/resize/check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Please note that libparted1.4 packages are actually
 newer than the libparted2 packages. I have re-numbered the
 packages because of problems with new, incompatible versions
 of libparted being released, and also to create more
 consistency of version numbers across the package. See
 README.Debian for more details.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: An integrated environment for writing TeX/LaTeX documents.
 AUC TeX can indent your text as you write it, let you run TeX/LaTeX
 and other LaTeX-related tools (such as a output filter or post
 processor) from within Emacs, and includes a wide range of Emacs
 macros to allow both easy insertions of LaTeX commands, and easy
 compilation, previewing, and printing of your TeX documents.
 .
 AUC TeX also lets you browse through compiling errors TeX reports,
 while it moves the cursor directly to the reported error and displays
 documentation for that particular error.  This will even work when the
 document is spread over several files.
 .
 Currently XEmacs ships with its own AUC TeX, so this package should only
 be used with GNU/Emacs.  (I.e. you don't need to install this package if
 your site uses only XEmacs.)

Description: Linux Cross-Reference
 The Linux Cross-Reference project is the testbed application of a
 general hypertext cross-referencing tool.  (Or the other way around.)
 .
 The main goal of the project is to create a versatile
 cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories.  The
 project is based on stock web technology, so the codeview client may
 be chosen from the full range of available web browsers.  On the
 server side, any Unix-based web server with cgi-script capability
 should do nicely.
 .
 The main feature of the indexer is of course the ability to jump
 easily to the declaration of any global identifier.  Indeed, even all
 references to global identifiers are indexed.  Quick access to
 function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros
 makes code browsing just that tad more convenient.  At-a-glance
 overview of e.g. which code areas that will be affected by changing a
 function or type definition should also come in useful during
 development and debugging.

MD5sum: ebcdc533043e7f637dc822640cf7ec8d
Description: User Folder workalike and replacement for Zope
 LoginManager is a User Folder workalike and replacement which solves the
 "N * M" problem seen with previous User Folders.  Because of its
 PlugIn-based architecture, it will almost never need to be subclassed to
 implement custom functionality. (For more information on the PlugIn
 system, see the Products.ZPatterns.PlugIns module source.)
 .
 LoginManager uses two kinds of PlugIns, the "User Source" and the "Login
 Method". User Sources provide an interface to an arbitrary store of user
 records. A LoginManager may contain multiple User Sources, and will
 search them in user-defined order until one returns a valid user object.
 .
 Login Methods are responsible for examining a REQUEST for identification
 and credentials. They are also indirectly responsible for authenticating
 the user. In most cases, they simply call user.authenticate(), passing
 the credentials (typically a password) they extracted from the REQUEST.
 A single LoginManager may contain multiple Login Methods, which are
 tried in user-defined order, and the result of the last Login Method is
 used. (Most Login Methods simply return the result of the previous Login
 Method if it had already validated a user. But the sequence is chained
 to allow for voting, multi-credential requirements, etc.)

 tasks giving all the functionality that would otherwise require
 tedious shell scripting to accomplish. PLEASE NOTICE that upstream
 considers this package "a broken program" and advises on his home
 page not to use run unless one is prepared to debug. However,
 run seems to be working reasonable well, but be warned.

Description: Linux Radio Transmission Decoder
 The multimon software can decode a variety of digital transmission modes
 commonly found on UHF radio. A standard PC soundcard is used to acquire
 the signal from a transceiver. The decoding is done completely in software.
 Currently, the following modes are supported:
     AX.25
         1200 Baud AFSK
         2400 Baud AFSK (2 variants)
         4800 Baud HAPN
         9600 Baud FSK (G3RUH)
     POCSAG
         512 Baud
         1200 Baud
         2400 Baud
     Miscellaneous
         DTMF
         ZVEI
 An arbitrary set of the above modes may run concurrently on the same input
 signal (provided the CPU power is sufficient), so you do not have to know
 in advance which mode is used. Note however that some modes might require
 modifications to the radio (especially the 9600 baud FSK and the POCSAG
 modes) to work properly.
 POCSAG (Post Office Code Standards Advisory Group) is a common paging
 transmission format.

Description: Compares a Packages files and a Sources file
 This is a program to compare a Packages files and a Sources file
 to see which programs need (re)compiled for any given architecture.
 .
 Quinn diff knows about architecture specific packages (e.g. lilo) and
 can easily exclude them via a Packages-arch-specific file.  The
 output is a list of source packages complete with accurate section
 and version information, suitable for use in build daemons or just in
 a script to auto-snarf the necessary source.

Description: Keep Track of Time worked on Projects
 From the author:
 Worklog is a program that helps you keep track of your time.  I wrote
 this program because I have several projects that require me to keep a
 timesheet.  I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing
 miscellaneous administrative tasks.  Rather than invoke an editor on a
 timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these
 tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two
 keystrokes the onset or change of any given task.  Worklog is a simple
 ncurses based program to do just that.

 This patch enables the "new" raid functionality, standard in 2.4.x kernels,
 to be used with 2.2.x kernels.  When running a kernel with this patch,
 one should install the raidtools2 Debian package, which will also facilitate
 upgrades of older raid arrays to the new structure.  New features include
 optional kernel autodetection of raid arrays at boot time, recognition of raid
 arrays when disk device names have changed, and "hot" adding and removal of
 devices to running raid arrays.  A small patch has been added to run the autodetect
 procedure when raid modules are loaded, thereby enabling initrd scripts to probe
 for and analyze filesystems on raid devices when looking for a "real" root
 filesystem.

Description: Improves integration between Python and C++ classes
 A lightweight mechanism, named "ExtensionClass",
 http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/ExtensionClass-1.0.2.tar.gz,
 has been developed for making Python
 extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
 extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
 treated like other python classes:
 .
  - They can be sub-classed in python,
  - They provide access to method documentation strings, and
  - They can be used to directly create new instances.
 .
 An example class shows how extension classes are implemented and how
 they differ from extension types.
 .
 Extension classes provide additional extensions to class and
 instance semantics, including:
 .
  - A protocol for accessing subobjects "in the context of" their
    containers.  This is used to implement custom method types
    and environmental acquisition.
  - A protocol for overriding method call semantics.  This is used
    to implement "synchronized" classes and could be used to
    implement argument type checking.
  - A protocol for class initialization that supports execution of a
    special '__class_init__' method after a class has been
    initialized.
 .
 Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
 extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
 models.

 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 75 dots

 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 The fonts from this package are not designed for big monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).  You can find big fonts in
 the package xfonts-cronyx-cp1251-100dpi.
 .
 The fonts are modified (mainly with Cyrillics added) versions of the
 most important X-Window fonts from 75dpi/.  Unfortunately Lucida is
 a regustered trademark, so these fonts use the name Serene inplace
 of Lucida.

 environment.
 .
 Multiple Ethernet Interfaces are supported by this DHCP package. You need
 to run Linux 2.0.32 or later.

 determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD and PC98
 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk)
 type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems supported are
 ext2, fat (FAT16 and FAT32) and linux-swap. Parted can also
 detect hfs (Mac OS), ntfs, reiserfs and ufs filesystems, but
 cannot create/remove/resize/check these filesystems yet.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Installer package for building daemontools binary package
 The following is taken from http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html.
 .
 daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.
 .
 supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the service
 if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise needs is a
 directory with a run script that runs the service.
 .
 multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally timestamps
 each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines matching specified
 patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the amount of disk space used.
 If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries again, without losing any data.
 .
 svscan starts one supervise process for each subdirectory of the current
 directory, up to a limit of 1000 subdirectories. svscan skips subdirectory
 names starting with dots. supervise must be in svscan's path.
 .
 If a subdirectory sub is sticky, svscan starts a pair of supervise processes,
 one for sub, one for sub/log, with a pipe between them. svscan needs two
 free descriptors for each pipe.
 .
 This package fetches the source from the internet, and then proceeds to
 create a .deb file from it.

 status  the server  uses the  system's load  average via  the "uptime"
 command.  If it  exceeds a  threshold, the  request is  denied  with a
 "server overloaded" HTTP error  message.  Future versions could assume
 the role  of a rough  traffic shaper too.   The module is  also fairly
 simple, and can be easily customized to fit particular purposes.

 (a must when one is making internationalized boot floppies). The
 programmer may use his gettexttified C source files just applying one
 small change to the main() function. The translator will work with the
 well known PO format.

Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

Description: Perl5 modules for client and server side SOAP implementation
 .
 SOAP::Lite is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple and
 lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) both
 on client and server side.
 .
 This version of SOAP::Lite supports the SOAP 1.1 specification ( see
 http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP ).  The main features of the library are:
 .
 o Supports SOAP 1.1 spec.
 o Provides full namespace support for SOAP 1.1.
 o Supports XML entity encoding.
 o Supports header attributes.
 o Supports HTTPS protocol.
 o Supports SMTP protocol.
 o Provides POP3 server implementation.
 o Supports Basic/Digest server authentication.
 o Provides COM interface.
 o Supports blessed object references.
 o Contains various reusable components (modules) that can be used
   independently, as, for instance, SOAP::Serializer and SOAP::Deserializer.
 o Provides an object oriented interface for serializing/deserializing and
   sending/receiving SOAP packets. Support for extensibility of the
   serialization/deserialization architecture has been included.
 o Supports serialization/deserialization of sophisticated object graphs
   which may have cycles (a circular queue would serialize just fine,
   as well as $a=\$a. See tests and documentation for more examples).
 o Supports arrays (both serialization and deserialization with autotyping).
 o Custom/user-defined types (see SOAP::Data::as_ordered_hash for example).
 o Supports ordered hashes (as working example of user-defined data types).
 o Customizable auto type definitions.

Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package (most
 likely xserver-xfree86).
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 A recommended minimal list of packages for such a configuration is:
 xbase-clients, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-base, xfonts-scalable,
 xlibs, xserver-common, xutils, an X server (usually xserver-xfree86, but some
 users may require a different one), a window manager (several are available,
 and which you use is largely a matter of preference), and a terminal emulator
 X client package (again, several are available and which you use is your
 decision).
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.4".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is
 thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms
 are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/share/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.

 compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).
 .
 Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
 is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
 machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
 variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
 etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

Description: LaTeX to HTML translator.
 LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.
 .
 Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the
 LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format. Because of certain
 legal limitations on the use of the GIF image format, GIF support is
 disabled in this package.

Description: a MusiXTeX extension for handling lyrics
 musixlyr is a set of TeX macros to be used with Taupin MusiXTeX
 (version T.52 or later) for typesetting vocal music. Its purpose is
 to compensate two drawbacks of MusiXTeX's lyrics handling:
 .
  * Typesetting lyrics with the "native" musixtex commands \zcharnote,
    \zsong etc. tends to be quite inefficient, particularly if the lyrics
    have to be changed or corrected.  The idea underlying musixlyr is to
    separate lyrics coding from music coding and let TeX weave them
    together with as little manual interference as possible.  As a result
    you can enter and edit lyrics (nearly) as easily as normal text.
 .
  * musixtex has no built-in mechanism for centering hyphens between
    syllables and for handling hyphenation at long melismas.  This is
    implemented in musixlyr following the example of engraved music.

       <wwwtable table-options...>
 .
         initial text (e.g. <caption> ... </caption>).
 .
         (X, Y) options for cell (X, Y)
         text for cell (X,Y)...
 .
         ((X,Y)) options for header cell X,Y
         text for header cell (X,Y)...
 .
       </wwwtable>
 .
 Rows and cells may be specified in any order, numbering starts at 1.
 X and/or Y may be replaced by a regular expression to indicate rows or
 columns.  Options or text (or both) may be omitted for cells.  Cells
 may be omitted completely if they are empty or fall under the
 rowspan/colspan specifications of another cell.  Cells may contain
 arbitrary HTML text, including other wwwtable tables.

 Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of

 heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

 Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get

 forms is handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human
 beings are good at. Combined with incremental text browsers, such
 as links, w3m (or even lynx), and screen(1), or netscape-remote
 a Surfraw liberateur is capable of research speeds that leave

 "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into

 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a SLIP link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 For diald to work the kernel *must* have SLIP devices, either compiled in
 or as a module, even if only PPP connections are made. In the latter case
 you should also have pppd, of course.
 .

 The library uses an opaque data type to represent a tree structure
 made of strings, data blocks, arrays and dictionaries (key-value pair
 lists). This structure can be manipulated, written out to and read in
 from a file, and synchronized with the contents of a file.  The
 purpose of PL is to closely mimic the behavior of the property lists
 used in GNUstep/OPENSTEP (there formed with the NSString, NSData,
 NSArray and NSDictionary classes) and to be compatible with it. PL
 enables programs that use configuration or preference files to make
 these compatible with GNUstep/OPENSTEP's user defaults handling
 mechanism, without needing to use Objective-C or GNUstep/OPENSTEP
 themselves.

Description: Mail proxy for firewalls with anti-spam and anti-relay features
 Smtpd uses two programs, smtpd which listens for incoming mail and places
 it in a private queue, and smtpfwdd, which invokes sendmail to deliver
 messages from the queue. The configuration file for smtpd has powerful
 features for controlling the acceptance of incoming mail.
 .
 It is particularly useful for firewall sites, where the policy aspects of
 which mail should be accepted (in smtpd's configuration file) are clearly
 separated from the routing and other aspects of the mail configuration
 (which remain in the sendmail configuration file)
 .
 It can be used with any mail-transport-agent which can be invoked as sendmail
 but is intended to integrate with the Debian sendmail package, which
 recognises when smtpd has been installed.

Description: HTML::Template : A module for using HTML Templates with Perl
 This module attempts make using HTML templates simple and natural.  It
 extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>.  The file
 written with HTML and these new tags is called a template.  It is
 usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
 someone else!  Using this module you fill in the values for the
 variables, loops and branches declared in the template.  This allows
 you to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate
 in the Perl script.

 Compared to the output of `makeinfo --html', texi2html's output is
 more customizable and (subjectively) produces better output by default.

 This includes linear adding of disks, RAID-0, RAID-4 and -5.
 .
 'New-style' RAID arrays have a lot features not present in the
 'older' RAID arrays, including autodetection. Old arrays can be upgraded
 with this package, and it is mostly a good idea to use this package
 when creating new RAID arrays.
 .
 In order to use this package, you must have a kernel with RAID drivers
 which aren't yet included in the stock kernels. You can find kernel
 patches for this at ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/alpha
 or from the kernel-patch-raid packages.

 This package contains documentation for ACE, including the man pages.
 .
 The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is a freely available open source
 object-oriented (OO) framework that implements many core design patterns for
 concurrent communication software. ACE provides a rich set of reusable C++
 wrappers and framework components that perform common communication software
 tasks across a range of OS platforms. The communication software tasks
 provided by ACE include event demultiplexing and event handler dispatching,
 signal handling, service initialization, interprocess communication, shared
 memory management, message routing, dynamic (re)configuration of distributed
 services, concurrent execution and synchronization.
 .
 ACE is targeted for developers of high-performance and real-time communication
 services and applications. It simplifies the development of OO network
 applications and services that utilize interprocess communication, event
 demultiplexing, explicit dynamic linking, and concurrency. In addition, ACE
 automates system configuration and reconfiguration by dynamically linking
 services into applications at run-time and executing these services in one or
 more processes or threads.

MD5sum: 51a826176cd9cace0c59d66b37cead2f
Description: aliases-style mail forwarding for qmail (source)
 This is a source only package for building fastforward binary
 package from source, because Dan Bernstein (fastforward's author)
 only gives permission for fastforward to be distributed in source form.
 .
 fastforward handles qmail forwarding according to a cdb database. It can
 create forwarding databases from a sendmail-style /etc/aliases or from
 user-oriented virtual-domain tables.
 .
 fastforward supports external mailing lists, stored in a binary format
 for fast access. It has a tool to convert sendmail-style include files
 into binary lists.
 .
 fastforward is more reliable than sendmail. sendmail can't deal with
 long aliases, or deeply nested aliases, or deeply nested include files;
 fastforward has no limits other than memory. sendmail can produce
 corrupted alias files if the system crashes; fastforward is crashproof.
 .
 fastforward's database-building tools are much faster than sendmail's
 newaliases. Even better, fastforward deliveries don't pause while the
 database is being rebuilt.
 .
 fastforward does not support insecure sendmail-style program deliveries
 from include files; you can use qmail's secure built-in mechanisms
 instead. fastforward does support program deliveries from /etc/aliases.

Description: Picon (Personal Images) database of individual Internet accounts
  "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into
 databases so that the appropriate image for a given e-mail address can
 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

Description: A language tool for constructing recognizers, compilers etc
 ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is
 a language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
 compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing C++
 or Java actions [You can use PCCTS 1.xx to generate C-based parsers].
 .
 Computer language translation has become a common task. While
 compilers and tools for traditional computer languages (such as C
 or Java) are still being built, their number is dwarfed by the thousands
 of mini-languages for which recognizers and translators are being
 developed. Programmers construct translators for database formats,
 graphical data files (e.g., PostScript, AutoCAD), text processing
 files (e.g., HTML, SGML).  ANTLR is designed to handle all of your
 translation tasks.

Description: Orthogonal Object Persistence in Relational Databases
 Tangram is an object-relational mapper. It makes objects persist in
 relational databases, and provides powerful facilities for retrieving
 and filtering them. Tangram fully supports object-oriented programming,
 including polymorphism, multiple inheritance and collections.
 It does so in an orthogonal fashion, that is, it doesn't require
 your classes to implement support functions nor inherit from a utility class.
 .
 Tangram builds upon DBI, so you'll need to install DBI and at least
 one DBD driver if that is not done already. You will also need
 Set::Object. These modules are available from CPAN.
 .
 If you intend to run the regression tests (recommended), you will
 also need to prepare an empty database before starting the installation
 procedure.

Description: the professional free ASCII text screen editor
 JOE, the Joe's Text Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  JOE has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has six help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 JOE has a great screen update optimization algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion, file selection menus,
 infinite undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, and block move, copy, delete or filter.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, JOE can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete immitation
 of WordStar, and a restricted mode version (lets you edit only the files
 specified on the command line).  JOE also has a deferred screen update to
 handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not bypassed by tty
 buffering.  It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work on any
 kind of terminal.

Description: The GNU time command.
 The `time' command runs another program, then displays information
 about the resources used by that program, collected by the system while
 the program was running.  You can select which information is reported
 and the format in which it is shown, or have `time' save the information
 in a file instead of display it on the screen.
 .
 The resources that `time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.
 .
 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

Description: Finds typographic errors in LaTeX
 * Supports over 40 warnings. Warnings include:
   + Commands terminated with space. Ignores ``\tt'', etc.
   + Space in front of references instead of ``~''.
   + Forgetting to group parenthesis characters when
     sub-/superscripting.
   + Italic correction (``\/'') mistakes (double, missing,
     unnecessary).
   + Parenthesis and environment matching.
   + Ellipsis detection; also checks whether to use ``\dots'',
     ``\cdots'' or ``\ldots''.
   + Enforcement of normal space after abbreviation. Detects most
     abbreviations automagically.
   + Enforcement of end-of-sentence space when the last sentence
     ended with capital letter.
   + Math-mode on/off detection.
   + Quote checking, both wrong types (``"'') and wrong direction.
   + Recommends splitting three quotes in a row.
   + Searching for user patterns.
   + Displays comments.
   + Space in front of ``\label'' and similar commands.
   + Use of ``x'' instead of ``$\times$'' between numbers.
   + Multiple spaces in input which will be rendered as one space
     (or multiple spaces, where that is undesirable).
   + Warns about text which may be ignored.
   + Mathematical operators typeset as variables.
   + No space in front of/after parenthesis.
   + Demands a consistent quote style.
   + Punctuation inside inner math mode/outside display math mode.
   + Use of TeX primitives where LaTeX equivalents are available.
   + Space in front of footnotes.
   + Bogus characters following commands.
 * Fully customizable. Intelligent resource format makes it possible
   to make ChkTeX respect your LaTeX setup. Even command-line options
   may be specified globally in the ``chktexrc'' file.
 * Supports ``\input'' command; both TeX and LaTeX version. Actually
   includes the files. ``TEXINPUTS''-equivalent search path.
 * Intelligent warning/error handling. The user may promote/mute
   warnings to suit his preferences. You may also mute warnings in
   the header of a file; thus killing much unwanted garbage.
 * Scripts included for checking CWEB files written in LaTeX.
   (Requires perl v5).
 * Supports both LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e.
 * Flexible output handling. Has some predefined formats and lets the
   user specify his own format. Uses a ``printf()'' similar syntax.
   ``lacheck'' compatible mode included for interfacing with the
   AUC-TeX Emacs mode.
 * ARexx scripts for interfacing with ScMsg and VBrowse are included.
   Special scripts included for CygnusED/GoldED, for binding to
   hotkey.
 * Amiga Workbench support. Parameters may be passed by
   shift-clicking the LaTeX files and setting the remaining options
   in the tooltypes.
 * Wildcard matching (Amiga only). Matches file patterns internally,
   thus saving a lot of work. This is, however, platform-specific
   code -- on UNIX boxes this is done by the shell.
 * Written in ANSI C. ``configure'' script included for easy setup
   and installation on UNIX systems.

MD5sum: d4e16e8157a055918855c5fbf6a77c7e
Description: A MIX emulator and MIXAL interpreter
 Mixal is an implementation of the imaginary computer called
 MIX and its assembly language MIXAL, which were invented
 by Donald E. Knuth in the 1960's for use in his monumental
 and yet unfinished book series "The Art of Computer Programming".
 All actual programs and all programming exercises in the series
 are written in MIXAL.
 .
 This package contains a modified version of Darius Bacon's Mixal
 implementation.  It takes a MIXAL source file, translates it to
 MIX machine code and then executes the resulting program, all in
 a single run.  The result of the assembler step cannot be extracted
 to a file.  Similarlly, one cannot take a precompiled MIX program and
 try to execute it in this emulator - only MIXAL source is accepted.
 .
 The MIX emulator does not (yet?) support floating-point operations
 nor the tape devices described in Knuth's book.  This is not fatal,
 however, and most of the programs and exercise answers in Knuth's
 book can be run in this MIXAL implementation.

MD5sum: f40fb712c2b143ee15e8e19bf2512dce
Description: Swap demon for dynamic swap file creation
 Swapd is a dynamic swapping manager for Linux. It provides the system with
 as much swap space (virtual memory) as is required at a particular time by
 dynamicly creating swap files. This is more convenient than using fixed swap
 files and/or partitions because they (a) are unused most of the time and are
 just taking up disk space; and (b) provide a limited amount of virtual memory.
 .
 On systems that have constant need for virtual memory it would still be
 wise to use a swap partition in parallel with dynamic swapping, since swap
 partitions provide much faster access than swap files.

Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems,
 CVS does not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at
 a time, but operates on hierarchical collections of directories
 consisting of version controlled files.
 .
 CVS helps to manage releases and to control the concurrent editing of
 source files among multiple authors.  CVS allows triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations and works well over a wide area
 network.

Description: Circumventing Debian package dependencies
 This is a dummy package which can be used to create Debian
 packages, which only contain dependency information.
 .
 This way, you can make the Debian package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages do depend on are actually installed.
 .
 Another possibility is creation of a meta package. When this
 package contains a dependency as "Depends: a, b, c", then
 installing this package will also select packages a, b and c.
 Instead of "Depends", you can also use "Recommends:" or
 "Suggests:" for less demanding dependency.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

Description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package. This is the
 replacement for the now obsolete CGI-modules package.
 .
 This package is destined to replace libcgi-pm-perl, but at the moment
 libcgi-pm-perl (as in the library CGI.pm) serves as the rapid
 prototyping version, and may be more featureful than this package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

 XScavenger is a platform game for the X Window System. From the README:
 .
 Scavenger is like Lode Runner. You've got to run around gathering objects
 while avoiding enemies. You can dig down through some of the blocks to get
 at buried objects. After you've collected everything, ladders may appear.
 To finish the level you've got to exit through the top of the screen. If
 an enemy falls into a dug brick, he is stunned for a while. If the brick
 fills in with him in it, he is killed, and he will reappear at the top of
 the screen.
 .
 This version has a level editor for designing your own levels, and a
 graphics editor for drawing your own artwork.

Description: A highway trip planner (GNOME interface)
 This is a highway trip planning program, similar to programs like
 Rand McNally's "TripMaker."  It allows you to plan road trips between
 two or more locations, using various interchangeable map files (or
 databases).
 .
 Currently, the program includes two databases covering North America;
 one is fairly simplistic, and one is quite detailed.  You can also
 create new databases with the included editor.
 .
 For retrocomputing nuts, this program traces its lineage back to a
 1980s program called "RoadRoute" written by Jim Butterfield for the
 Amiga.  AFAIK all of the code has been rewritten, but the Basic-USA
 database included here is Jim's original dataset.
 .
 This package includes the GNOME interface and the database editor
 (which also requires GNOME).

 written in C++ and can be used with Unix systems running X Windows
 (Motif look), PC's running Microsoft Windows NT or `95 (native look),
 or Macintosh systems running MacOS (native look).
 .
 The Amulet research project in the School of Computer Science at
 Carnegie Mellon University is creating a comprehensive set of tools
 which make it significantly easier to create graphical,
 highly-interactive user interfaces. The lower levels of Amulet are
 called the `Amulet Toolkit,' and these provide mechanisms that allow
 programmers to code user interfaces much more easily.  Support is
 provided for: object selection, save/load, undo, and constraints.
 .
 As the group at Carnegie Mellon University is no longer funded for
 its work on Amulet, some Amulet users have founded the OpenAmulet
 project which has continued its development.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 then convert the phonemes to a sequence of vocal tract parameters, and
 then synthesise the sound a vocal tract would make to say the sentence.
 Recite can perform a subset of these operations, so it can be used to
 convert text into phonemes, or to produce an utterance based on vocal
 tract parameters computed by some other program.

Description: Daemon and utilities for full NTP v4 timekeeping participation.
 The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on
 networked computers.  The ntpd daemon implements NTP, allowing Unix
 systems to participate in this synchronization.
 .
 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .
 For more information on how NTP works, and how to configure a campus of
 ntpd daemons, load the optional Debian package 'ntp-doc'.
 .
 The Perl suggestion is only to allow use of the entirely optional ntpsweep
 utility.  Feel free to ignore it if you just want the daemon.

 uses a controlled amount of memory, shares index files and memory cache among
 processes or threads and compresses index files to 50% of the raw data. The
 structure of the index is configurable at runtime and allows inclusion of
 relevance ranking information. The query functions do not require to load all
 the occurences of a searched term. They consume very few resources and many
 searches can be run in parallel.

 This package contains files required to boot an NFS-Root disk image. It
 also contains template files for setting up individual hosts.
 .
 Using this package is more secure then diskless-image-simple, as only
 one partition needs read-write access, and it is completely refreshed
 from a read-only NFS mount on every boot. If you suspect somebody
 has cracked into your NFS-root host, rebooting it will restore it back to
 its original state. However, this makes it slower to boot then the
 diskless-image-simple.

 .
 It displays a symbolized traffic light. When the light is red, no
 demand-dialing is possible; when it is yellow, demand-dialing has been
 enabled but there is currently no connection using any of the ISDN
 network devices; when it is green, there is at least one active
 connection using an ISDN network device. You can interactively switch

Description: perl HTML::SimpleParse - a bare-bones HTML parser.
 It is a bare-bones HTML parser, similar to HTML::Parser, but with
 a couple important distinctions:
 .
 First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which start
 tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in the <HEAD>
 portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse does not know any
 of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it, it
 does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does
 distiguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting
 tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on).
 .
 Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
 content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to
 balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags are
 inside other pairs of tags.

 variables, V1 a vector called the right hand side, and V2 a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

Description: FreeType 1, The FREE TrueType Font Engine, shared library files.
 The FreeType 1 engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering engine.
 It has been developed to provide TT support to a great variety of platforms
 and environments.
 .
  Note: FreeType 2 (libfreetype soname 6, Debian packages libfreetype6 and
        libfreetype6-dev) has arrived.  The FreeType 2 API is a lot simpler
        than the one in 1.x while being much more powerful.  We thus
        encourage you to adapt your source code to it as this should not
        involve much work.

Description: Cleans up files in directories based on their age
 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.

Description: Software Upgrade Protocol implementation
 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon
 University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in
 identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are:
 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the
 specifications for a given file collection so that the file server
 need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file
 scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that
 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

 Garlic is probably the most portable molecular visualization program
 in the Unix world. It's written for the investigation of membrane
 proteins. It may be used to visualize other proteins, as well as some
 geometric objects. The name should has something to do with the
 structure and operation of this program. This version of garlic
 recognizes PDB format version 2.1. Garlic may also be used to analyze
 protein sequences.
 .
 Features include (but not limited to):
  o The slab position and thickness are visible in a small window.
  o Atomic bonds as well as atoms are treated as independent drawable
    objects.
  o The atomic and bond colors depend on position. Five mapping modes
    are available (as for slab).
  o Capable to display stereo image.
  o Capable to display other geometric objects, like membrane.
  o Atomic information is available for atom covered by the mouse
    pointer. No click required, just move the mouse pointer over the
    structure!
  o Capable to load more than one structure.
  o Capable to draw Ramachandran plot, helical wheel, Venn diagram,
    averaged hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment plot.
  o The command prompt is available at the bottom of the main window.
    It is able to display one error message and one command string.

Description: Linux kernel source for version 2.2.19
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.2.19.
 .
 You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing "make config"
 and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and
 tk4X-dev and try "make menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use
 interface. Also, on intel platforms, you MUST get bin86 if
 you wish to compile the kernel sources. Ignore the suggestion to get bin86
 for non intel architectures. Also, please read the detailed documentation
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-source-2.2.19/README.headers.gz.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.  (Until now, the only
 option available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking
 PC as a terminal.)  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you
 start emacs with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
 everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on how well you
 can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs :-).
 This package includes speech servers written in tcl to support the
 DECtalk Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech synthesizers.  For
 other synthesizers, look for separate speech server packages such as
 emacspeak-ss.

Description: System for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX
 TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic
 Alphabet) symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for
 either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and derived from the tsipa package, made
 in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and Shirakawa Shun.  Its
 primary distribution site is
 ftp://tooyoo.L.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/TeX/tipa.
 .
 Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as
 compared with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA
 symbols:
 .
   * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which
     includes all the symbols and diacritics found in the recent
     versions of IPA and some non-IPA symbols.
   * Complete support of LaTeX2e.
   * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles.
   * Easy input method in the IPA environment.
   * Extended macros for accents and diacritics.
   * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'.
   * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams.
   * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with
     Times Roman and Helvetica fonts.
 .
 There is another package called tipa-type1 which contains the PostScript
 type 1 fonts for TIPA.

Description: A high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Text-Query-SQL provides query builders for SQL databases
 Text-Query-SQL is derived from the Text-Query module.
 What is Text-Query then ? It is a general purpose query
 parser and resolver. It is able to parse the AltaVista 'simple
 query' and 'advanced query' syntax. The resulting syntax tree
 is then used to build a search query that depends on the
 database used.
 .
 Text-Query-SQL provides query builders for
 SQL databases. Searching 'foo and bar' will retrieve rows containing
 the words foo and bar. It does it by generating the appropriate SQL
 request.
 .
 At present Text-Query-SQL only supports MySQL
 but one could easily add support for any other database
 (see DATABASE file), the module was architectured to make this easy.

Description: LaTeX support for CWEB.
 This is the distribution of LaTeX CWEB, a bundle that allows you to
 use LaTeX as the documentation markup of your CWEB program. Your CWEB
 programs may be LaTeX documents now -- with sections, subsections,
 environments, figures, graphics inclusion, etc.
 .
 You will want to use this bundle if you
  - are a CWEB programmer and use LaTeX elsewhere,
  - haven't used CWEB up to now, because you wanted structured markup
    (and you didn't want to develop it yourself), or
  - want a hierarchic document structure for CWEB programs.
 .
 If you want to LaTeX the example program, you will need the rcs-latex
 package, although this is not essential.

 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 bibindex converts a .bib file to a .bix file, which is a compact
 binary representation of the .bib file containing hash tables for
 fast lookup, as well as byte offset positions into the corresponding .bib
 file.
 .
 biblook provides an interactive lookup facility using the .bix and .bib
 files.  It verifies that the file version number and bibindex version
 number match its own values, and also compares the file time stamps
 so that it can detect whether the .bix file is out-of-date with
 respect to the .bib file.  In either case, execution terminates.
 .
 This Debian package features a command line history mechanism through
 the GNU readline library (an item listed in the upstream ToDo list).

Description: Allows you to play melodies from your built-in speaker
 Ditty enables you to play simple melodies from the command line. It does NOT
 require a sound card, as it can use the built-in speaker to play these
 melodies just as easily. (Note: in order for the built-in speaker to be used,
 ditty's stdout must be connected to a tty.  Certain terminal emulators, such
 as xterm, don't support the sound controls.  If you aren't using the sound
 card method, you should generally run ditty from a *real* pseudo-terminal).
 .
 Some things that may make ditty fun to use are:
 Adding sound-effects to .bash_login and .bash_logout or other shellscripts.

 updating the extension HEIGHT and WIDTH parameters in HTML IMG tags.
 These parameters help many browsers (including Netscape) to multi-thread
 image loading, instead of having to load images in strict sequence in
 order to have each one's dimensions available so the next can be placed.
 This generally allows text on the remainder of the page to load much
 faster.

 The package needs either the imagemagick package or both the file and
 libjpeg-progs packages.  In the latter case, you must use the --no-magick
 command-line option.

 files, but ras has a mode in which the extra files are exactly the
 same size as the original files.

 Ras was originally intended for transporting a large file split over
 several floppy disks in a manner resilient to the corruption of a few
 of the disks, and a pair of example shell scripts to do this (rassplit
 and rasmerge) is included in the distribution.

 containing information which changes from time to time. For example
 you might want to have a page which provides an overall system summary
 of data collected nightly. Or maybe you have a catalog of data and
 images that you would like formed into a spiffy set of web pages for
 the world to browse. Python is a great scripting language for these
 tasks and with HTMLgen it's very straightforward to construct objects
 which are rendered into consistently structured web pages. Of course,
 CGI scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as
 well.

Description: Manipulates and accesses URI strings
 From the README:
 .
 This package contains the URI.pm module with friends.  The module
 implements the URI class.  Objects of this class represent Uniform
 Resource Identifier (URI) references as specified in RFC 2396.
 .
 URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various
 components that make up these strings.  There are also methods to
 combine URIs in various ways.
 .
 The URI class replace the URI::URL class that used to be distributed
 with libwww-perl.  This package contains an emulation of the old
 URI::URL interface.  The emulated URI::URL implement both the old and
 the new interface.

Description: English dictionary of synonym sets, much like a thesaurus.
 WordNet(®) is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is
 inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
 memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized
 into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical
 concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.
 .
 WordNet was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory
 (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University under the
 direction of Professor George A. Miller (Principal Investigator).

Description: Options Parsing Tool shared library
 opt is a subroutine library which facilitates the convenient input
 of parameters to a C program. Parameters are parsed from a command
 line, with further facilities for reading options from files, from
 environment strings, or from an interactive environment. The aim of
 the opt package is to permit programs to be both user- and
 programmer- friendly. The package attempts to on the one hand
 provide a direct and relatively full-featured input interface to the
 ultimate user of the program, and at the same time impose a minimal
 amount of work on the programmer to "attach" the package to his or
 her software. It is similar to GNU's (and AT&T's old) getopts
 package, but with a different interface that might be easier to use.

 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changes
 in the application sourcecode.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing an common interface
 to lowlevel libraries such as DirectX, Svgalib, X11, GGI, etc. While
 platform independency is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game sdk. In other words, we have put great effort in to
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's easy of use - while maintaining it's
 power.
 .
 See http://www.clanlib.org/ for more info

 This package contains html documentation and manpages for most ClanLib

Description: Network UPS Tools
 This daemon can monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware and can provide
 notification to other computers via it's client/server architecture. One
 computer is configured to act as a master and the others are configured
 as slaves.
 .
 This package provides the best features of the other Debian UPS packages
 but is not based on any of them. Specifically, it is better because:
 .
 1) it has the  ability to talk to a wide variety of hardware in both
 dumb and smart modes, similar to genpower; and
 .
 2) it has network capability in that it can act as a UPS server (master) for
 other UPS client boxes (slaves), similar to apcd.
 .
 Finally, the companion package, nut-cgi, provides cgi scripts that can
 display the status of UPS on a web page.

 IP subnet, network or routing table lookups.  The data
 structure is based on a radix tree using a radix of two, so
 sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix" as
 well.  The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval"
 but is pronounced like "try".  Patricia stands for
 "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded as
 Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table
 lookups by Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance
 characteristics are well-known as it has been employed for
 routing table lookups within the BSD kernel since the 4.3

Description: Show Me The Money is a configurable Perl/Tk stock ticker program
 smtm, which is a not overly clever acronym for Show Me The Money, is a
 simple stock ticker application. It creates and automatically updates a
 window with stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance. When called with one or several
 stock symbols, it displays these selected stocks, and also records the
 symbols for later use. When smtm is called without arguments, it reads the
 symbols tickers from a (default or specified) file. This file can be created
 explicitly by calling the Save option from the File menu, or implicitly
 whenever smtm is called with one or more symbols.
 .
 smtm is fully configurable -- it can display the stock symbol and the full
 name of the company, the price change, the percentage change, the volume
 traded, the profit or loss, the value of the holding, the length of the
 holding period as well as annualised percentage returns. The display can be
 sort on almost any of the columns.  Loosers are flagged in red. smtm can be
 used for North American equities, as well as European and Australian/NZ
 ones. It should work for other markets supported by Yahoo! Finance.
 .
 The quotes are delayed, typically 15 minutes for NASDAQ and 20 minutes
 otherwise, see Yahoo! Finance for details.

Description: ILU Documentation
 Documentation for the Inter-Language Unification system by Xerox PARC.
 .
 The Inter-Language Unification system (ILU) is a multi-language object
 interface system.  The object interfaces provided by ILU hide implementation
 distinctions between different languages, between different address spaces,
 and between operating system types. ILU can be used to build multi-lingual
 object-oriented libraries ("class libraries") with well-specified
 language-independent interfaces. It can also be used to implement distributed
 systems. It can also be used to define and document interfaces between the
 modules of non-distributed programs. ILU interfaces can be specified in either
 the OMG's CORBA Interface Definition Language (OMG IDL), or ILU's Interface
 Specification Language (ISL).
 .

Description: perl Tie::Cache - LRU Cache in Memory.
 This module implements a least recently used (LRU) cache in memory
 through a tie interface. Any time data is stored in the tied hash, that
 key/value pair has an entry time associated with it, and as the cache
 fills up, those members of the cache that are the oldest are removed to
 make room for new entries.
 .
 So, the cache only "remembers" the last written entries, up to the size
 of the cache. This can be especially useful if you access great amounts
 of data, but only access a minority of the data a majority of the time.

Description: Alternative Debian package manager
 dftp is another program to maintain your Debian installation. It
 downloads the lists of currently available packages via FTP, compares
 them to the installed packages and lets you interactively select
 which new/upgraded packages you want to install. Dependencies of new
 packages are checked and missing packages offered for installing,
 too. Then all selected packages are fetched with FTP and verified for
 correctness. Installation of packages is done via dpkg, and ordered
 by dependencies.
 .
 dftp's main advantage over other interfaces to Debian package
 management is that it can (partially) run on a different machine than
 the target system, if that doesn't have direct FTP access. Scanning
 the current installation and installing packages must of course be
 done on the target system. But package selection and download can be
 moved to a different machine. dftp can also run on non-Debian
 systems. Therefore it is also available as a standalone version (Perl
 script) in /debian/project/misc.

Description: generate/apply patch files with more functionality than plain diff
 This package contains a pair of programs, makepatch and applypatch, to
 assist in the generation and application of patch kits to synchronise
 source trees.
 .
 makepatch knows about common conventions for patch kits (it generates
 Index: and Prereq: lines, it patches patchlevel.h first, it can use
 manifest files), plus it prepends some shell code which if run will
 take care adding directories, removing files, setting execute mode on
 scripts, and the like.
 .
 applypatch uses some extra data supplied by makepatch to verify both the
 patch and the source directory before applying the patch.  Afterwards it
 will clean up the directory tree plus fix up the permissions and even
 the timestamps on the patched files.

Description: TCP flow recorder
 tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the
 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
 separate file for later analysis.
 .
 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows
 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.
 .
 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore
 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like
 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured
 with 'tcpdump -w'.
