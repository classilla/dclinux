Description: Installer package for building daemontools binary package
 The following is taken from http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html.
 .
 daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.
 .
 supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the service
 if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise needs is a
 directory with a run script that runs the service.
 .
 multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally timestamps
 each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines matching specified
 patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the amount of disk space used.
 If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries again, without losing any data.
 .
 svscan starts one supervise process for each subdirectory of the current
 directory, up to a limit of 1000 subdirectories. svscan skips subdirectory
 names starting with dots. supervise must be in svscan's path.
 .
 If a subdirectory sub is sticky, svscan starts a pair of supervise processes,
 one for sub, one for sub/log, with a pipe between them. svscan needs two
 free descriptors for each pipe.
 .
 This package fetches the source from the internet, and then proceeds to
 create a .deb file from it.

 .
 dnscache is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive DNS queries from local

 responses from remote DNS servers. It caches the responses to save time later.
 .
 tinydns is a DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from hosts around the
 Internet, and responds with locally configured information.
 .
 pickdns is a load-balancing DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from
 hosts around the Internet, and responds with a dynamic selection of locally
 configured IP addresses with 5-second TTLs.
 .
 walldns is a reverse DNS wall. It accepts iterative DNS queries for in-addr.arpa
 domains from hosts around the Internet, and supplies generic responses that avoid
 revealing local host information.
 .
 rbldns is an IP-address-listing DNS server. It accepts iterative DNS queries from
 hosts around the Internet asking about various IP addresses.  It provides responses
 showing whether the addresses are on a locally configured list, such as RBL or DUL.
 .
 axfrdns is a DNS zone-transfer server. It reads a zone-transfer request in
 DNS-over-TCP format from its standard input, and responds with locally configured
 information.

Description: An implementation of Ted Nelson's ZigZag
 GZigZag is an implementation of Ted Nelson's ZigZag concept, which is
 a new way of looking at computers. Instead of a filesystem which is
 basically a hierarchically arranged system of binary chunks of data,
 or a spreadsheet which basically is a two- or three-dimensional grid,
 you have a real multidimensional hyperstructure system.  It is a kind
 of a crossing between a database, a filesystem, a personal
 information manager and many others. And even that isn't sufficient
 to describe it: it's simply something new.

Description: ILU Documentation
 Documentation for the Inter-Language Unification system by Xerox PARC.
 .
 The Inter-Language Unification system (ILU) is a multi-language object
 interface system.  The object interfaces provided by ILU hide implementation
 distinctions between different languages, between different address spaces,
 and between operating system types. ILU can be used to build multi-lingual
 object-oriented libraries ("class libraries") with well-specified
 language-independent interfaces. It can also be used to implement distributed
 systems. It can also be used to define and document interfaces between the
 modules of non-distributed programs. ILU interfaces can be specified in either
 the OMG's CORBA Interface Definition Language (OMG IDL), or ILU's Interface
 Specification Language (ISL).

 commercial Java IDEs. Features include:
  - source code editing with syntax highlighting and auto indentation
  - compilation with automatic jump from error messages to responsible line
    in the source code.
  - run Java application in an interactive (comint) Emacs buffer
  - integrated debugging with interactive debug command buffer and automatic
    display of current source file/line when stepping through code
  - browse JDK doc, using the browser of your choice
  - browse your source code, using the Emacs etags facility or a
    tree-structured speedbar.
  - easily and infinitely customizable

 LxDoom is a version of Doom, designed to run on Linux either under XFree86 or
 using SVGALib.
 .
 LxDoom is based on Boom, a freely available port of Doom for DOS, written by
 TeamTNT (http://www.teamtnt.com/).
 .
 This package includes only the network game server and the required game
 wad file (boomlump.wad). To actually play lxdoom, you require lxdoom-x
 or lxdoom-svga, depending on whether you're going to play lxdoom on the
 console or X. Packages which may also enhance your gameplay are
 lxdoom-sndserv and lxmusserv, which are the sound server and music server
 packages, respectively.

 mp3burn is a perl script that allows you to burn audio CDs composed

 written to FIFOs, so they don't consume a lot of filesystem space during
 the burn.

Description: a MusiXTeX extension for handling lyrics
 musixlyr is a set of TeX macros to be used with Taupin MusiXTeX
 (version T.52 or later) for typesetting vocal music. Its purpose is
 to compensate two drawbacks of MusiXTeX's lyrics handling:
 .
  * Typesetting lyrics with the "native" musixtex commands \zcharnote,
    \zsong etc. tends to be quite inefficient, particularly if the lyrics
    have to be changed or corrected.  The idea underlying musixlyr is to
    separate lyrics coding from music coding and let TeX weave them
    together with as little manual interference as possible.  As a result
    you can enter and edit lyrics (nearly) as easily as normal text.
 .
  * musixtex has no built-in mechanism for centering hyphens between
    syllables and for handling hyphenation at long melismas.  This is
    implemented in musixlyr following the example of engraved music.

  Radius Cinepak 24 bits Color (Quicktime, AVI)
  Radius Cinepak  8 bits Gray  (Quicktime, AVI)
  Creative CYUV                (AVI)

  Intel Indeo 3.2              (Quicktime, AVI)
  Intel Ray YUV                (Quicktime, AVI)
  Intel Indeo 4.1              (Quicktime, AVI)
  Intel Indeo 5.0              (Quicktime, AVI)
 .
 You will need an Internet connection to download these modules from
 the author's FTP site; Debian's permission to distribute these
 modules is so restricted that this is the only reasonable way to
 handle the situation.
 .
 The author only provides binaries for Intel (glibc 2.1), Alpha and
 PowerPC.  SPARC, ARM, m68k, and Hurd users will find this package
 extremely useless.
