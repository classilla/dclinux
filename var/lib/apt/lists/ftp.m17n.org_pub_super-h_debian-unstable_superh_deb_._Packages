Description: Add and remove users and groups to resp. from the system.
 This package includes the adduser and deluser commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
 o Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
    existing groups.
 o Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from specific
    groups.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and gecos.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after each of the commands

Description: A high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recomments", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 In order to unpack and build Debian source packages you will need to
 install the developers' package `dpkg-dev' as well as this one.

Description: The headers and static libraries for ext2fs-aware tools-development.
 EXT2FS stands for "Extended Filesystem", version 2. It's the filesystem
 type used for hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and shared libraries needed to compile
 ext2fs-aware programs. Only programmers that really manipulate
 features specific to the ext2 filesystem will need this. Most
 programmers will use the generic filesystem-independent interface
 from libc.
 .
 It also contains dev files for the e2p lib used by
 the e2fsprogs, but which is not yet packaged all by itself
 because it lacks documentation. It may also lack some support
 files, by I can't really know until someone uses it...
 .
 libe2p is for user-level e2fsprogs commands.  It's used by dumpe2fs,
 chattr, and lsattr.  Functions in libe2p typically have two
 characteristics (a) don't require that block device containing the
 filesystem be opened directly (functions in libext2fs do), and (b)
 libe2p typically contains printf statements or parse user input, and so
 have more internationalization issues.

 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

  * btree. A representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
  * hashed. An extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
  * UNIX file oriented. A byte stream file with fixed or variable
    length records.
 Other core database services:
  * page cache management for fast access, clean page allocation.
  * lock with multiple reader/writer granularity.
  * nested transaction support with logging and rollback recovery
    (two phase commit).
  * Large set of utilities, to dump/load/restore data and examine log.

 Boehm's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc.
 This package is required to compile and link programs that use
 libgc5.
 .
 Since the collector does not require pointers to be tagged, it does
 not attempt to ensure that all inaccessible storage is reclaimed.
 However it has typically been more successful at reclaiming unused
 memory than most C programs using explicit deallocation.  Unlike
 manually introduced leaks, the amount of unreclaimed memory typically
 stays bounded.

 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: shar, unshar, uuencode, uudecode
 `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
 them for transmission by electronic mail services.  `unshar' helps
 unpacking shell archives after reception.  Other related utility
 programs help with other tasks.
 .
 `uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic
 channel which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high
 order bit) of bytes.  `uudecode' does the converse transformation.

Description: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.0.x)
 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 Lan Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.0.4b-2, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x and the new smbfs utilities for 2.2.x kernels have been
 merged in a single package called smbfs. A wrapper script called smbmount.sh
 identifies the version of the kernel running and calls the correct binary.
