Description: An easy way of transcribing folk and traditional music
 ABC2MTeX is a package written to typeset tunes stored in an ascii
 format or abc notation.  It was designed primarily for folk and
 traditional tunes of Western European origin (such as Irish, English
 and Scottish) which can be written on one stave in standard classical
 notation.  However, it can act as a fast preprocessor for multi-stave
 music and should be extendible to many other types of music.
 .
 The package is small, easy to use and features, amongst other things,
 the ability to transpose both the music and the abc notation.  It
 will also create an index of all the tunes you have transcribed.
 .
 The ability to write tunes in abc notation means that they can be
 easily and portably stored or transported electronically.  This
 package allows you to typeset them easily too.  In addition the
 notation is not specifically tied to MusicTeX and similar packages
 have been written to translate to other formats such as postscript
 and MIDI.
 .
  (Note: MusicTeX is not packaged for Debian because MusicTeX is old.
         Please the new-and-better MusiXTeX package instead.  :)

Description: aliases-style mail forwarding for qmail (source)
 This is a source only package for building fastforward binary
 package from source, because Dan Bernstein (fastforward's author)
 only gives permission for fastforward to be distributed in source form.
 .
 fastforward handles qmail forwarding according to a cdb database. It can
 create forwarding databases from a sendmail-style /etc/aliases or from
 user-oriented virtual-domain tables.
 .
 fastforward supports external mailing lists, stored in a binary format
 for fast access. It has a tool to convert sendmail-style include files
 into binary lists.
 .
 fastforward is more reliable than sendmail. sendmail can't deal with
 long aliases, or deeply nested aliases, or deeply nested include files;
 fastforward has no limits other than memory. sendmail can produce
 corrupted alias files if the system crashes; fastforward is crashproof.
 .
 fastforward's database-building tools are much faster than sendmail's
 newaliases. Even better, fastforward deliveries don't pause while the
 database is being rebuilt.
 .
 fastforward does not support insecure sendmail-style program deliveries
 from include files; you can use qmail's secure built-in mechanisms
 instead. fastforward does support program deliveries from /etc/aliases.

 As "Curses" opens, you're hunting about in the attic of your family home,
 looking for a tatty old map of Paris (you're going on holiday tomorrow) and
 generally trying to avoid all the packing.  Aunt Jemima is potting daisies
 and sulking; the attics are full of endless distractions and secrets; Greek
 myths, horoscopes, sixth-century politics, a less than altogether helpful
 demon, a mysterious bomb plot, photography, ritual, poetry and a dream or
 two all get in your way; and somehow you keep being reminded of your family
 through the ages, and all its Curses...
 .
 -- could it be that even you are Cursed?

Description: Jigsaw, An Interactive History by Graham Nelson
 New Year's Eve, 1999, a quarter to midnight and where else to be but
 Century Park! Fireworks cascade across the sky, your stomach rumbles
 uneasily, music and lasers howl across the parkland... Not exactly your
 ideal party (especially as that rather attractive stranger in black
 has slipped back into the crowds) - but cheer up, you won't live to
 see the next.
 .
 "Jigsaw" begins at the very end of the Twentieth Century, but the action
 ranges over the past hundred years, covering the most critical historical
 moments of the period: from assassinations to world war, from pop music
 to the space race.  But throughout it all, just WHO is Black?

 Can you keep body and soul together while you find and deliver the
 evidence?

Description: Convert JPEG compressed images to PostScript Level 2
 jpeg2ps converts JPEG files to PostScript Level 2 or 3 EPS. In fact, jpeg2ps
 is not really a converter but a "wrapper": it reads the image parameters
 (width, height, number of color components) in a JPEG file, writes the
 according EPS header and then copies the compressed JPEG data to the output
 file. Decompression is done by the PostScript interpreter (only PostScript
 Level 2 and 3 interpreters support JPEG compression and decompression).
 If you have a slow communication channel and a fast printer, sending
 compressed image data is a big win.

 Moria's dungeons are populated by monsters, some of which are inspired by
 J.R.R. Tolkien's books.  The goal of the game is to find and kill the
 Balrog, whereupon the player is crowned King.  Your player can be created
 from a combination of 8 races (human, half-elf, elf, halfling, gnome,
 dwarf, half-orc, half-troll) and 6 classes (warrior, mage, priest, rogue,
 ranger, paladin), and is measured by 6 attributes (strength, dexterity,
 intelligence, wisdom, constitution, and charisma).

 correctly read their configuration files at startup, making it
 easy to replace these programs with the mail user shell. (A know
 exception is the handling of mail got via the Post Office Protocol
 which uses different keywords.)

 This package contains an unofficial version of mush, with many
 changes for making it work on a Debian Linux system and a revamped
 Post Office Protocol support. It also contains support for sending
 MIME messages.

 This is OpusTeX beta-test Version 0.84 (February 1998).  This package
 contains the OpusTeX macros, musixflex, OpusTeX User's Manual in LaTeX
 source and DVI formats, and example source OpusTeX music score files.
 .
 OpusTeX is a set of versatile and power TeX macros to typeset polyphonic,
 orchestral or choral music.  It allows very fine control and produces
 professional printed music scores.
 .
 OpusTeX is still a beta-test Version and only dedicated for those, who
 want to work with and--more important--to work on.
 .
 Due to the important amount of information to be provided to the
 typesetting process, coding OpusTeX might appear to be awfully
 complicated, especially for beginners.  Therefore, it is recommended
 to use OpusTeX with some pre-processors such as ABC2MTeX.
 Visit the GMD Music Archive at http://www.gmd.de/Misc/Music/ and check
 the MuTeX Mailing List Archive for more information.

 Andrew Plotkin, the author of So Far, writes:
 .
 "This is a shortish-to-medium-sized game.  More than a short story,
 less than a full-length novel.  Its rating is `cruel.'  It is possible
 to make mistakes which will prevent you from winning.  Sometimes common
 sense will serve to avoid such mistakes; sometimes insight is necessary;
 sometimes neither will help.  Save often, and keep your old saved games.
 .
 "Do not expect `So Far' to be anything like `A Change in the Weather'.
 It's not."
 .
 You'll need a Z-code (i.e. Infocom-format) game interpreter, such as
 XZip or Frotz, to run this game.

Description: Source only package for building ucspi-tcp binary package
 Written by Dan J. Bernstein, tcpclient and tcpserver are
 powerful easy-to-use command-line tools for building TCP
 client-server applications. tcpserver provides TCP access control
 features, similar to tcp-wrappers/tcpd's hosts.allow but much
 faster; it can run high-availability services much better than
 inetd.
 .
 Real-time Blocking List support is also included in tcpserver, so
 you can run qmail-smtpd with it and avoid a lot of SPAM.
 .
 tcpclient and tcpserver conform to UCSPI, the UNIX Client-Server
 Program Interface, using the TCP protocol.
 .
 Dan Bernstein (ucspi-tcp's author) only gives permission for his code
 to be distributed in source form, or binary by approval.  This package
 has been put together to allow people to easily build a binary
 package for themselves, from source.
 .
 If there is a package called ucspi-tcp available, then Dan has approved the
 binary version of the package for distribution, so you might as well install
 that and save yourself some effort.

Description: A Change in the Weather, an interactive short story
 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you wander away
 from it.  Some exploration -- on your own -- is an appealing thought.
 You come across a chattering stream, a weathered old wooden bridge,
 a tall lone tree and a weatherbeaten shed.  After a strange dream,
 you embark on a mission; but there's hardly enough time to succeed...
 .
 Andrew Plotkin, the author of A Change in the Weather, writes:
 .
 "A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER is a cruel game, by the Zarfian Interactive
 Fiction Rating System. Any choice you make may be a wrong choice,
 and you may not discover it was wrong until later; and not choosing is
 always a choice.  Timing may be critical. Save often and keep your old
 saved games."
 .
 You'll need a Z-code (i.e. Infocom-format) game interpreter, such as
 XZip or Frotz, to run this game.

 the pills have been cleared from a level, the difficulty level is notched
 up, and a new level is generated. If you collide with a ghost, all the pills
 are replaced, and you restart the current level from scratch. A new feature
 just added is the presence of large red pills that for a short time turn the
 ghosts grey and let you eat them.
