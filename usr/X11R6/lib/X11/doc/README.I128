1.  Supported hardware

The current accelerated I128 server supports

   o Imagine 128 (I128 with Texas Instruments TVP3025 or IBM528 RAMDAC). It
     has been tested with with 4MB of VRAM.

   o Imagine 128 Ticket 2 Ride (I128-T2R with IBM526 or 528 RAMDAC). It has
     been tested with 4 MB and 8 MB of VRAM and DRAM.

   o Imagine 128 Revolution 3D (I128-R3D with IBM526 RAMDAC).  It has been
     tested with 4 MB, 8 MB, and 16 MB of WRAM or SGRAM.

   o Imagine 128 Revolution IV (I128-R4 with SILVERHAMMER RAMDAC).  It has
     been tested with 32 MB.

2.  Features:

   o uses linear frame buffer

   o Resolutions up to the maximum supported by the card should be possible.

   o 8 bpp, 16 bpp (depth 15 and 16), and 32 bpp (depth 24, sparse) are sup-
     ported.

   o supports RGB Sync-on-Green

   o Makes use of the graphics accelerator.

3.  Configuration:

The I128 driver should auto-detect all supported hardware so you needn't have
anything other than the Identifier in the Section "Device" of the XF86Config
file.  When running the XF86Setup or xf86config programs one merely needs to
select an I128 card so that the correct server will be used.  One need not
and should not specify a RAMDAC, clockchip or allow the setup program to
probe for clocks. The driver will auto-detect the amount of video ram pre-
sent.

The following Section "Device" options are supported by the MGA driver:

   o Option "dac_8_bit"

     Will enable 8-bit DAC support.

   o Option "no_accel"

     Will disable all hardware acceleration.

   o Option "sync_on_green"

     Will enable syncing on green for sync-on-green monitors (these are typi-
     cally fixed frequency workstation monitors).

4.  Mode lines for the SiliconGraphics flat panel display:

   o These mode lines are required for use with the T2R4 (Rev 4) and the Sil-
     iconGraphics Flat Panel display.
