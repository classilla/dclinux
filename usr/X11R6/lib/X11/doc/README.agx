1.  General Notes

This server currently supports the IIT AGX-016, AGX-015, AGX-014 and XGA-2
chipsets. The AGX chipset is based on XGA architecture, but is missing sev-
eral features and differs on others. There's also untested support for the
XGA-1 and AGX-010 chipsets.  Pixel depths of 8bpp, 15bpp, 16bpp are generally
supported.  Unpacked 24bpp (RGBX 32bpp) is not yet stable enough to release.

RAMDACs currently supported are the Brooktree (BT481, BT482, and BT485) and
AT&T (20C505) RAMDACs used by the Hercules Graphite series, and Sierra RAM-
DACs (15025 and 15021), and Generic VGA RAMDAC. Untested support has been
added for the AT&T 20C490 series.

The current driver has a number of acceleration routines: solid and dashed
zero-width lines (except AGX-014), bitblt fills, tiles, and stipples, solid
arc and polygon fills, character glyphs and font cache for 8-bit characters.

Boards that have had some testing include ISA and VLB versions of most of the
Hercules Graphite series, Spider Black Widow VLB and Black Widow Plus VLB,
Boca Vortek VL, CatsEye/X XGA-2, and the PS/2-57 planar XGA-2. The Orchid
Celsius is very similar to the Spider and Boca boards, except some batches
may use one of the AT&T 20C490 series RAMDACs, instead of the Sierra 15025.
There has also been a report of a generic board that uses a UMC RAMDAC that
may be an AT&T 20C490 Clone.

First, to Hercules Customer Support for providing a loaner board to get
things started.

Second, to the XFree86 team, and those who who have contributed to their
efforts to the project, for the foundation of work that provided a basis for
bootstrapping this server.

3.  Known Problems

   o The accelerated line routines don't match lines written by the mi/cfb
     routines. This is noticeable when switching between virtual consoles
     while running routines that draw and erase lines. Seems to have been
     reduced/fixed in previous releases but need more testing.

   o Some special-case speedup added to cached font rendering in 3.1.1 has
     been disabled as is over-aggressive in some cases. This cuts the perfor-
     mance on terminal-fonts in half, and font performance is already low for
     the AGX chips compared to their contemporaries.

   o As in all software, needs more testing.

4.  ToDo

   o Address the above known problems.

   o Additional acceleration routines and general performance improvements.
     Many existing acceleration routines are Q&D adaptations of existing rou-
     tines from other servers that support graphics chips that differ signif-
     icantly, architecturally, from that XGA and are undoubtedly less than
     optimal. In particular some of the general per-operation overhead to
     set-up the graphics context should be moved to the ValidateGC() rou-
     tines.

   o Complete HW cursor support, most of the code is done (or borrowed from
     other servers). There just remains a little setup code and then finding
     a lot of time to debug and test the numerous permutations.

   o Complete support for the Graphite Pro's 84-pin RAMDAC.  (the 2MB version
     of the Graphite Pro has both RAMDACs, the 1Mb only the 44-pin RAMDAC).
     Currently, the 84-pin RAMDAC is only supported in clock-doubled pixmux
     mode, the server will switch between RAMDACs as required by the video
     mode In >8bpp modes this switching does not occur.

   o Implement more HW probing, this will be difficult as it appears some
     (all?) AGX-based vendors don't implement the VESA VXE POS registers,
     although the AGX chip does support it (and some vendors claim VXE com-
     pliance...).  There are a few rev/vendor registers in the AGX chip but
     they are not documented. Note: SuperProbe also does not support probing
     for AGX/XGA chips. ISA POS probing is supported for the XGA chips and
     some code for EISA POS is also included but not tested.

   o Micro-optimizations, in particularly reducing processing overhead for
     common special cases that don't require full generality.

5.  XF86Config

Device Section Entries and Options Currently Supported:

The minimum that must be specified in the XF86Config device section for the
AGX-014, AGX-015, AGX-016, and ISA-based XGA-1 and XGA-2 is the Chipset. How-
ever to get full capability out of the AGX-01[456] chips, the RAMDAC should
be specified.  Other parms may select additional capabilities, or may used to
override the defaults or reduce start-up time be suppressing probing. XGA
specific configuration is covered at the end of this document. The XGA
entries can generally be used to override defaults for the AGX-01[456] as
well.

      Ramdac
            Be sure to check the clock rating of the RAMDAC(s) on your video
            board and don't exceed that rating even if the server allows it,
            overclocking RAMDACs will damage them.

            The clock rating generally appears as a suffix to the part num-
            ber, may only have the most significant digit(s), and may be
            mixed with other codes (e.g. package type). For example, an 85MHz
            Bt481 in a plastic J-lead package has a part number of Bt481KPJ85
            and a 135MHz AT&T20C505 has a part number of ATT20C505-13. Sierra
            stamps the rated speed below the part numbers in a dark ink.

                  "normal"
                        normal VGA style RAMDAC (6-bit DAC), default if none
                        specified. Most boards should work with this parm,
                        but some capabilities will be unavailable. Only 8bpp
                        is available.

                  "bt481"
                        bt481 RAMDAC (supports 8-bit DAC)

                  "bt482"
                        bt482 RAMDAC (supports 8-bit DAC) The Hercules
                        Graphite HG210 uses the BT481 or BT482, the only dif-
                        ference between these two is the BT482's HW cursor
                        (not yet supported).  The BT481/2 are limited to
                        85Mhz.  8bpp, 15bpp, 16bpp are supported.

                  "ATT20c490"
                        AT&T490 RAMDAC (includes 49[123] - supports 8-bit
                        DAC). Limited to 110Mhz at 8bpp. 8bpp, 15bpp, and
                        16bpp are supported.

                  "SC15025"
                        Sierra SC15025 and SC15021 RAMDAC (support 8-bit
                        DAC). The SC15025 is limited to 125Mhz, and the
                        SC15021 135Mhz. Check the RAMDAC's actual rating,
                        some SC15025's used in AGX based boards are only
                        rated to 110Mhz. 8bpp, 15bpp, and 16bpp are sup-
                        ported.

                  "herc_dual_dac"
                        Hercules Graphite Pro RAMDAC probe.  If the 84-pin
                        Big-RAMDAC is installed (2MB models), will use the
                        Big RAMDAC, but only clocks-doubled, pixel- multi-
                        plexed modes (higher clock values only!). Lower
                        clocks and resolutions in 8bpp mode are supported by
                        switching to the Small 44-pin RAMDAC. 15bpp and 16bpp
                        are supported.

                        There has been one report of the "dac-8-bit" option
                        not working with a Graphite Pro equipped with a BT485
                        RAMDAC, puzzling since it should be identical to the
                        AT&T20C505 in this regard. No startup messages or
                        XF86Config were submitted to aid problem isolation.

                        Not supported by the HG210 Graphite.

                  "herc_small_dac"
                        Hercules Graphite Pro RAMDAC probe.  Forces use of
                        only the BT481/482 RAMDAC. 8bpp, 15bpp, 16bpp, and
                        unpacked 24/32bpp are supported.

                        Not supported by the HG210 Graphite.

                  "xga"
                        To allow overriding the default VGA style RAMDAC con-
                        trol for the AGX-010.

      Ramdac related Option Flags:

                  "dac_6_bit"
                        Sets RAMDAC to VGA default 6-bit DAC mode (default
                        for "normal").

                  "dac_8_bit"
                        Sets supported RAMDAC's to 8-bit DAC mode (default
                        for all but "normal").

                  "sync_on_green"
                        Composite sync on green for RAMDAC's that support
                        this feature (BT481/481 and AT&T20c490). However,
                        whether any boards have necessary traces and glue
                        logic is doubtful.

      Chipset:
            Must be specified, possible values: "AGX-016", "AGX-015",
            "AGX-014", "AGX-010", "XGA-2", or "XGA-1". Some AGX vendors place
            stickers over the chip, in general, if it's a VLB board it's
            probably an AGX-015 and if it's an ISA board it may be an
            AGX-014. The Hercules Graphite Power Pro and Spider Black Widow
            Plus use the AGX-016 chipset. In general, specifying a lower
            revision in the AGX-0{14,15,16} series does not seem to causes
            problems (except lower performance from the AGX-014's non-accel-
            erated line drawing).

            Note: Only the AGX-016, AGX-015, AGX-014 and XGA-2 have had any
            testing. Most of the development has been with an AGX-015 based
            2MB Hercules Graphite VL PRO (HG720) and most of testers for pre-
            vious releases had AGX-014 based 1MB Hercules Graphite (HG210).

            The limited documentation I have for the AGX-010 is that is is a
            clone of the XGA architecture with a few additional configuration
            registers. What is not clear is whether to use XGA or extended-
            VGA RAMDAC control registers.  The post-3.1.1 default is now VGA
            control registers, but XGA control registers can be forced with
            the XGA RAMDAC parm.  Likewise the configuration parms described
            in the XGA section can be used to override the AGX defaults for
            I/O and memory addresses.

      VideoRam:
            Will be probed if not specified. The startup will be a little
            faster if specified.

      Tuning Option flags:

                  Bus I/O interface:

                              "8_bit_bus"
                                    Force 8-bit I/O bus.

                              "wait_state", "no_wait_state"
                                    Set or clear CPU access wait state,
                                    default is the POST setting.

                              "fifo_conserv"
                                    Disable Memory I/O Buffer, AGX-015 and
                                    AGX-016.  MS-Windows driver default.
                                    Required by some VLB systems with
                                    `aggressive timing'.  The default for
                                    this server is to disable the buffer.

                              "fifo_moderate"
                                    Enable the AGX-015/016's Memory I/O
                                    buffer.

                              "fifo_aggressive"
                                    Enable the AGX-016's extra-large buffer.
                                    Either option may result in garbage being
                                    left about the screen, disabled by
                                    default.  A good test is the xbench or
                                    x11perf dashed lines tests, if random
                                    dots are drawn, fifo_conserv is required.
                                    So far, no boards have been reported that
                                    worked correctly with the buffers
                                    enabled.

                  Memory Timing:
                        POST defaults should be ok.

                              "vram_delay_latch",      "vram delay_ras",      "vram_extend_ras"
                                    Vram timing options.

                              "slow_vram",      "slow_dram"
                                    Set all of the vram timing options.

                              "med_dram"
                                    Set vram latch delay, clear others.

                              "fast_vram",
                                         "fast_dram"" All of the vram timing
                                    options are cleared.  Should be specified
                                    if directly specifying VRAM options in
                                    order to clear POST settings.

                  Debugging:
                        These shouldn't generally be required:

                              "noaccel"
                                    (AGX,XGA) Disable Font Cache.

                              "crtc_delay"
                                    (AGX) Force XGA mode CRTC delay.

                              "engine_delay"
                                    AGX-015 only? adds additional VLB wait
                                    state.

                              "vram_128", "vram_256"
                                    Sets VRAM shift frequency, vram_128 is
                                    for 128Kx8 VRAM. Default is to leave this
                                    bit unchanged from POST setting.

                              "refresh_20", "refresh_25"
                                    Number of clock cycles between screen
                                    refreshes. Default is to leave this bit
                                    unchanged from POST setting.

                              "screen_refresh"
                                    Disable screen refresh during non-blanked
                                    intervals, AGX-016. Default is leave them
                                    enabled.

                              "vlb_a", "vlb_b"
                                    VLB transaction type, default is to leave
                                    this bit unchanged from POST value.

      Virtual resolution:
            The server now accepts any virtual width, however the actual
            usable CRTC line width is restricted when using the graphics
            engine and depends upon the chip revision. The CRTC line width
            and not the virtual width determine the amount of memory used.
            The server currently does not make use of any of the unused CRTC
            line's memory. CRTC line width is restricted by the following
            rules:

                 AGX-014 : 512, 1024 and 2048. (also AGX-010)

                 AGX-015 : 512, 1024, 1280, and 2048.

                 AGX-016 : 512, 640, 800, 1024, 1280, and 2048.

                 XGA,AGX-010 : 512, 640, 800, 1024, 1280, 1152, and
                 2048.

            When panning I occasionally get streaks if the virtual resolution
            is much greater than the physical resolution.  Moving the mouse a
            little makes it disappear. The Hercules manual indicates this
            also happens with the MS-Windows drivers.

            The server requires at least a 64KB scratchpad (16KB for XGA's).
            Additional memory is useful for font cache and a larger scratch-
            pad.

      AGX Clocks:
            Probing is supported, but of course the usual warnings and dis-
            claimers apply. Probing may momentarily subject your monitor to
            sweep frequencies in excess of its rating.  The cautious may wish
            to turn off the monitor while the probe is running.

            Once clocks are known, they can be entered into XF86Config, then
            subsequent runs won't probe clocks and will be quicker to
            startup. For the clock probe it is recommended that the X server
            be run with the -probeonly option. The values in the clocks
            statement are the hardware input clocks and correspond to the
            pixel clock only at 8bpp in direct-clocking RAMDAC modes. The
            server will divide/multiply those values as appropriate for the
            RAMDAC modes available at the current pixel depth. The available
            pixel clocks will be displayed in the startup messages.

            For the 2MB Hercules Graphites, with the "herc-dual-dac" RAMDAC
            specified, earlier versions of the server generated an additional
            16 clocks with values doubled and some zeroed.  Those are no
            longer needed and you should re-probe and re-enter the clock val-
            ues to ensure all clocks are available to you.

            The AGX-015 2MB Hercules Graphite VL Pro with an ICS1494M
            9251-516 clock chip has probed clock values of:

                                25.18  28.80  32.70  36.00  40.00  45.00  50.40  64.70
                                70.10  76.10  80.60  86.30  90.40  95.90 100.70 109.40

            Actual values according to Hercules are:

                                25.175 28.322 32.512 36.000 40.00 44.90 50.35 65.00
                                70.00  75.00  80.00  85.00  90.00 95.00 100.0 108.0

            These are the values to be used in the clock statement if speci-
            fying the "normal", "bt481", or "herc_small_dac" RAMDAC in your
            XF86Config and your clockchip matches that above.

            Clock probing assumes that the first clock is 25.175Mhz and uses
            that to derive the rest. A warning is displayed if the second is
            not near 28.322Mhz. If this warning appears, you should not use
            the probed clock values without additional verification from
            other sources.

            In the case of the AGX-014 and later AGX's, only the external
            clock select lines are used, this means the clock values corre-
            spond to the values of the video board's clock chip.

            For the AGX-010, the first 8 clocks use the standard XGA internal
            clock selects and the second 8 are based on AGX extensions. For
            the XGA-1 only 8 clocks are available.  The XGA-2 uses a pro-
            grammable clock and no clocks or clockchip line is required.

            The maximum pixel clock generally allowed is 85MHz, but some RAM-
            DACs support higher values. In any case you, should check your
            RAMDAC, some RAMDACs used on AGX based boards are produced in
            versions rated to lesser values than the server assumes. You
            should check the rating and limit yourself to that value.

      Modes:
            One difference I've noted from the Mach8, is that the AGX's CRTC
            doesn't like the start of the horizontal sync to be equal to
            horiz blank start (vert sync may have the same problem, I need to
            test some more). Interlaced and +/-sync flags are supported but
            have had very little testing. For interlaced modes make sure the
            number of lines is an odd number.

            The doublescan flag is now supported, however the minimum clock
            supported is generally 25MHz, so resolutions of less than 400x300
            are not likely to be supported by most monitors.  In creating
            doublescan mode timings, the vertical timings will match the
            apparent resolutions, e.g. for 400x300 the timings should
            describe 300 lines, not 600.

6.  Xga configuration

          This server now has tested support for XGA-2 compatible boards
(aka. XGA-NI). The main issue for XGA-1 support is whether clock probing
works. At this time probing for board configuration is limited and detailed
configuration may need to be done manually.

       By default the ISA POS register will be performed. If the XGA Instance
number is specified the scope of probing will be narrowed a bit. To override
or disable probing, a minimum of the Instance, COPbase, and MEMbase must be
specified in the XF86Config device section for the XGA card. MCA probing is
not supported.

      Instance       nn
            XGA instance number (0-7).

      IObase        nnnn
            The I/O address of the the XGA general control registers. The
            standard, and default, is 0x21i0, where i is the instance number.

      MEMbase        nnnn
            The XGA display memory address (the address the XGA coprocessor
            uses for video memory). This is also the system memory address of
            the linear aperture on boards that support it.

            POS register 4 bits 7-1 contains bits 31-25 of the XGA's display
            memory address. Bits 24-22 of of the display memory address con-
            tains the XGA instance number.  Bit 0 of POS register 4 is not
            used by this server as the XGA's linear aperture is not used.
            However, the coprocessor must still be configured with this.

            The AGX-01[456] chips have a fixed display memory address.

      COPbase     nnnnnn
            Address of the graphics engine's memory mapped control registers.

            Typically:

            0xC1C00 + (ext_mem_addr * 0x2000) + (instance * 0x80)

            where ext_mem_addr is the high order 4-bits of POS register 2
            (0-16 the server assumes zero).

            The AGX-01[456] chips support 0xB1F00 (default) and 0xD1F00.

      BIOSbase     nnnnnn
            Address of the XGA BIOS (not VGA BIOS).  Can be specified as an
            alternate to COPbase.

            Typically:

            0xC0000 + (ext_mem_addr * 0x2000)

            where ext_mem_addr is the high order 4-bits of POS register 2
            (0-16 -- the server assumes zero).

      VGAbase        nnnn
            Can be used to override the default 0xA0000 address for the 64KB
            video memory address used by the server. The only values accept-
            able are 0xA0000 and 0xB0000. VGA text mode restore does not work
            under Linux if 0xB0000 is specified.

            AGX-01[456] also default to 0xA0000.

      POSbase       nnnn
            Can be used to specify an alternate POS register probe address
            base from the ISA default of 0x100. The VESA VXE standard for
            EISA is 0xzC80, where z is the slot number).

            A value of zero will disable POS register probing (required for
            MCA).

      DACspeed      nnnn
            Can be used to override the servers default maximum Pixel Clock
            for XGA-2 of 80Mhz.  The limit can be raised as high as 90Mhz, or
            set to lower values.

        An alternate way to determine the POS register values is with the
setup/diag programs that should have been included with your video board, or
possibly from jumper values.

The XGA-2 has programmable clocks up to 90MHz, however at 1024x768, 72MHz is
generally the max that will produce a stable display with the CatsEye/XGA-2
used for testing (IBM coprocessor and INMOS RAMDAC/serializer). Higher clocks
will often generate artifacts at the top and left edges of the screen. Such
artifacts can sometimes be tuned out by increasing the vertical and horizon-
tal blanking intervals or slightly changing the clock. At pixel clock rates
above 80Mhz I have seen the chip lose sync after running for several minutes,
so 80Mhz has been set as the default limit for XGA-2 pixel clocks. I don't
have specs on actual limits, and as there are a number of different XGA
chipsets, you should use the modes documented in your owner's manual as a
guide to max refresh rates. No clocks or clockchip parm are required to spec-
ify use of programmable clocks for the XGA-2.

8bpp and 16bpp are supported for the XGA-2.

For XGA-1 cards the clocks must be specified as for the AGX chips, it is not
known whether the clockprobing will work. Some XGA-1 chips may support 16bpp.
