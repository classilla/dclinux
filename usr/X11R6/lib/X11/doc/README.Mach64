1.  Supported Cards, RAMDACs, and Bits Per Pixel

The Mach64 X server supports 8bpp with a dot clock up to 80MHz on all Mach64
based cards.  On most cards, higher dot clocks and additional depths are
available (see the table below).  What determines this support is the RAMDAC
on your card.

[*] - The dot clocks are limited to 80MHz and the bpp is limited to 8.

The table above specifies the maximum resolution and the video memory
required to run this maximum resolution.  Smaller resolutions will require
less video memory.

The RAMDAC is reported when you run the Mach64 X server with the "-probeonly"
command line option.  The RAMDAC reported should be correct for all Mach64
cards.  It can also be specified in the XF86Config file, but this is not rec-
ommended unless the RAMDAC reported in the probeonly output is incorrect.
Before specifying the RAMDAC in your XF86Config file visually verify which
RAMDAC is on your Mach64 card.  If the RAMDAC reported in the probeonly out-
put is definitely different than what you see on the card, then check to see
if you have a RAMDAC specified in your XF86Config file.  If you do, comment
this line out and re-run the Mach64 X server with the "-probeonly".  If it
still reports the incorrect RAMDAC, please send in a bug report to
XFree86@XFree86.Org.

The ATI68860 RAMDACs are usually found on ATI Graphics Pro Turbo and ATI Win-
Turbo cards.  The IBM RGB514 RAMDAC is found on the ATI Graphics Pro Turbo
1600 card.  The other RAMDACs are usually found on ATI Graphics Xpression,
ATI Video Xpression and ATI 3d Xpression cards.  Mach64 CT, ET, VT, VT3, VT4,
LT, GT (3D Rage), 3D Rage II, 3D Rage IIC, 3D Rage II+DVD, Rage Pro, and Rage
LT Pro chips have an "Internal" RAMDAC (i.e., it is built into the Mach64
chip).

As advertised, Mach64 graphics cards can use a special 24bpp mode (packed
pixel mode), but this is not currently supported in the Mach64 X server.
This will be added in the next major release.

The Mach64 X server requires the video memory aperture to function properly.
This means that ISA Mach64 cards in systems with more than 12Mb of main mem-
ory will not work.  If you have a PCI based Mach64 card or a VLB based Mach64
card, then the Mach64 X server will work with any amount of main memory.

Accelerated doublescan modes are supported on VT, VT3, VT4, LT, GT, Rage II,
Rage IIC, Rage II+DVD, Rage Pro and Rage LT Pro based Mach64 cards.  Mach64
cards with other chips cannot handle accelerated double scan modes due to a
hardware limitation.  Non-accelerated doublescan modes should work with the
ATI driver in the SVGA X server for all Mach64 cards.

2.  Optimizing the speed of the Mach64 X server

To maximize the speed of the Mach64 X server, I suggest that you use the fol-
lowing maximum resolutions.  This will allow room for the font and pixmap
caches and a hardware cursor.

     Max Resolution   BPP   Video RAM
     --------------   ---   ---------
       1600x1200       8       8Mb
       1600x1200      16       8Mb
       1280x1024      32       8Mb

       1280x1024       8       4Mb
       1280x1024      16       4Mb
        1024x767      32       4Mb

       1280x1024       8       2Mb
        1024x767      16       2Mb
         800x600[*]   32       2Mb

        1024x767       8       1Mb
         800x600[*]   16       1Mb

[*] - With a 2MB video card, the only way to use the font and pixmap caches
is to have a virtual resolution of 1024x480 with a 640x480 mode.  I suggest
using 800x600 to maximize your screen size at the cost of the speed gained
from the caches.  The same argument can be made for 1MB video cards running
in 16bpp mode.  Note that it is not possible to run in 32bpp mode with 1MB of
video memory.

Technical explanation for the above suggestions: The Mach64 X server uses a
font and pixmap cache that is only available at a screen width of 1024 or
greater.  This restriction will be removed in a future version of the X
server.  To obtain the best performance from your video card, you need to
make sure that there is enough room off-screen for the caches (at least
1024x256).  In addition to the cache, the Mach64 uses memory mapped registers
which are mapped to the last 1024 bytes of the memory aperture.  This takes
away another line from video memory.  Thus, you need at least a video memory
area of 1024x257.

3.  XF86Config options

Several options are supported in the "Device" section for the Mach64 X
server.  By default, the Mach64 X server will determine the RAMDAC type from
the BIOS.  If you wish to override the default RAMDAC type (not recommended
unless the BIOS incorrectly reports your RAMDAC type), you can specify the
RAMDAC type in the XF86Config file with the "Ramdac" entry.  The Mach64 X
server will also program the clocks based on the clock chip read from the
BIOS.  If you wish to override the default clock chip type (not recommended
unless the BIOS incorrectly reports your clock chip type), you may specify
the clock chip in the XF86Config file with the "ClockChip" entry.  If, how-
ever, you wish to use the preprogrammed clocks, you can turn off the clock
programming with the "no_program_clocks" option.  In this case, the Mach64 X
server reads the Clocks from the BIOS.  The "Clocks" lines in the XF86Config
file are normally ignored by the Mach64 X server unless the "no_bios_clocks"
option is given.  Note on newer Mach64 cards (CT, ET, VT, GT, 3D Rage II, 3D
Rage II+DVD and Rage Pro) the "Ramdac", "ClockChip" and "Clocks" lines have
no meaning and should not be included in your XF86Config file.

      Option "sw_cursor"
            This option allows you to use the software cursor instead of the
            hardware cursor.

      Option "hw_cursor"
            This option turns on the hardware cursor.  This should not be
            necessary since the hardware cursor is used by default unless the
            "sw_cursor" option is specified.

      Option "composite"
            This option will set the composite sync for monitors that require
            this.

      Option "dac_8_bit"
            This option enables 8 bits per RGB value.  Note that this does
            not work with the Chrontel 8398 RAMDAC.  This options is not nec-
            essary since 8 bits per RGB value is the default for the Mach64 X
            server for all Mach64 cards except those with the Chrontel 8398
            RAMDAC.

      Option "dac_6_bit"
            This option enables 6 bits per RGB value.

      Option "override_bios"
            This option allows you to specify a video mode that the video
            card's BIOS believes to be illegal.  Some BIOSs have incorrect
            maximum resolution and/or dot clock limitations.  Use this option
            with extreme care.  It is possible to specify a video mode that
            can damage your card or monitor.

      Option "no_block_write"
            This option allows you to turn off block write mode.  Block write
            mode only works on certain types of VRAM cards.  This option has
            no effect on DRAM based cards.  If you see noise on the screen
            that can be captured via xmag, then it is probably a problem with
            block write mode being turned on when it should not.  This
            ``noise'' usually looks like bits of windows/menus repeated on
            the screen.

      Option "block_write"
            This option allows you to turn on block write mode.  Block write
            mode only works on certain types of VRAM cards, and this option
            has no effect on DRAM based cards.  If you want to override the
            probed default, you can use this option.  Note that this may
            result in ``noise'' appearing on the screen.

      Option "power_saver"
            This option allows the server to use the power saving features of
            certain "green" monitors instead of blanking when the screen
            saver is activated.  This option is still experimental.

      Option "no_program_clocks"
            This option allows you to disable the clock programming.  Nor-
            mally the Mach64 server will program the clocks based on the
            clock chip type unless this option is given.  With this option,
            the clocks are either read from the BIOS or, if the
            "no_bios_clocks" option is set, set from the Clocks line.

      Option "no_bios_clocks"
            This option allows you to override the clocks read from the video
            card's BIOS and use the clocks specified in the Clocks line in
            your XF86Config file.  Normally the Mach64 server will ignore
            both the BIOS clocks and the clocks specified in the Clocks line
            unless the "no_program_clocks" options is set (see above).

      Option "no_font_cache"
            This option allows you to disable the font cache.  By default the
            font cache is turned on if the horizontal resolution is 1024 pix-
            els or greater and there is enough off-screen video memory to
            hold the cache.

      Option "no_pixmap_cache"
            This option allows you to disable the pixmap cache.  By default
            the pixmap cache is turned on if the horizontal resolution is
            1024 pixels or greater and there is enough off-screen video mem-
            ory to hold the cache.

      Option "fifo_conservative"
            This option allows you to use a more conservative display fifo
            value.  If you are experiencing snow or vertical banding on the
            screen, try adding this option to see if it fixes the problem.

      MemBase baseaddress
            This entry specifies the video memory aperture address.  By
            default the aperture address is automatically determined and this
            option should not be necessary.  If the Mach64 X server is dying
            with a seg. fault, then the memory aperture might not be cor-
            rectly determined.  To fix this try setting the aperture address
            to another location.

      ClockChip "type"
            This entry specifies the clock chip type.  The following values
            are valid for type:

               o ati18818

               o att20c408

               o ch8398

               o ibm_rgb514

               o ics2595

               o stg1703

      Ramdac "type"
            This entry specifies the RAMDAC type.  The following values are
            valid for type:

               o ati68860

               o ati68860b

               o ati68860c

               o ati68875

               o att20c408

               o ch8398

               o ibm_rgb514

               o internal

               o stg1702

               o stg1703

               o tlc34075

      DacSpeed "MHz"
            This entry allows you to override the default maximum dot clock.
            Use this option with extreme caution.  If you specify a MHz value
            too large for your card, you can damage it.

6.  Known Problems and Bug Reports

There are several known problems with the current version of the Mach64 X
server.  They include:

   o Gamma correction is not currently supported.  It will be supported in a
     future release.

   o Screen blanking in 16bpp and 32bpp modes on certain Mach64 CT cards does
     not work.

   o In doublescan modes, only the top half of the hardware cursor is dis-
     played.  The hardware cursor works fine in all other modes.

   o With high refresh rates on certain cards (VT-A3 and CT-D) noise can
     become a problem in 32bpp mode.  This usually only happens with refresh
     rates of 85Hz or greater and can be fixed by using a lower refresh rate
     (e.g., 72Hz or 75Hz).

   o ISA cards with more than 12Mb of main memory cannot use the server due
     to the requirement of a video memory aperture.  This a major project.

If you are experiencing problems, first check to make sure that you have the
very latest available release (including beta releases).  ATI releases new
cards throughout the year.  Each of these new cards require additional pro-
gramming to support the new Mach64 chips, RAMDACs and clock chips that appear
on them.  The most recent release is most likely to support your video card.

Second, please check the RELNOTES and README files (as well as the other doc-
umentation available with the release).  Third, make sure you do not have any
Ramdac, ClockChip or Clocks lines in your XF86Config file (all of these are
automatically detected by the Mach64 X server).  The "Device" section should
only contain the Identifier, VendorName and BoardName.  All other options
should be automatically detected.

If you are still experiencing problems, please send e-mail to
XFree86@XFree86.org or post to the comp.windows.x.i386unix newsgroup.

Please do NOT send e-mail to me since the developers who answer e-mail sent
to XFree86@XFree86.org are better able to answer most questions and I would
like to spend my minimal free time working on new enhancements to the X
server.  Thanks!
