1.  Readme for the XFree86 3.3.3 LinkKit

  1.  For systems which don't use gcc-2, you may need to install libgcc.a if
      the binary distribution you are using was built with gcc-2.

  2.  Make sure that you have the XFree86 3.3.3 libraries installed under
      /usr/X11R6 if you will be linking Xnest with the LinkKit.  The LinkKit
      is now self-contained for the other servers.

  3.  Edit the xf86site.def file to define which servers you want to build,
      and the drivers and extensions you want included.

         o Set HasGcc and HasGcc2 to match the compiler you are using if the
           defaults aren't correct.

         o If the LinkKit was built with gcc-2.x and you are using some other
           compiler, you must install libgcc.a and set NeedLibGcc to YES.

         o To build the 256 colour server: set XF86SVGAServer to YES.

         o To build the 16 colour server: set XF86VGA16Server to YES.

         o To build the monochrome server: set XF86MonoServer to YES.

         o To build the S3 server: set XF86S3Server to YES.

         o To build the Mach8 server: set XF86Mach8Server to YES.

         o To build the Mach32 server: set XF86Mach32Server to YES.

         o To build the Mach64 server: set XF86Mach64Server to YES.

         o To build the P9000 server: set XF86P9000Server to YES.

         o To build the AGX server: set XF86AGXServer to YES.

         o To build the ET4000/W32 server: set XF86W32Server to YES.

         o To build the IBM 8514/A server: set XF86I8514Server to YES.

         o To build the I128 server: set XF86I128Server to YES.

         o To build the GLINT server: set XF86GLINTServer to YES.

         o To build the TGA server: set XF86TGAServer to YES.

         o To build the GA-98NB/WAP server: set XF98GANBServer to YES.

         o To build the NEC480 server: set XF98NEC480Server to YES.

         o To build the NEC-CIRRUS/EPSON NKV/NKV2 server: set XF98NKVNEC-
           Server to YES.

         o To build the WAB-S server: set XF98WABSServer to YES.

         o To build the WAB-EP server: set XF98WABEPServer to YES.

         o To build the WSN-A2F server: set XF98WSNAServer to YES.

         o To build the Trident Cyber9320/9680 server: set XF98TGUIServer to
           YES.

         o To build the Matrox Millennium/Mystique Server: set XF98MGAServer
           to YES.

         o To build the Cirrus Logic CLGD7555 Server: set XF98SVGAServer to
           YES.

         o To build the EGC server: set XF98EGCServer to YES.

         o To build the NEC S3 server: set XF98NECS3Server to YES.

         o To build the S3 PW/PCSKB server: set XF98PWSKBServer to YES.

         o To build the S3 PW/LB server: set XF98PWLBServer to YES.

         o To build the S3 GA-968 server: set XF98GA968Server to YES.

         o To build the Xnest server: set XnestServer to YES.

         o If you are building more than one Xserver, uncomment the Server-
           ToInstall line and set it to the name of the Xserver you want to
           be the default server (i.e., the one that the ``X'' sym-link
           points to).

         o Set XF86SvgaDrivers to the list of drivers you want to include in
           the SVGA server.

         o Set XF86Vga16Drivers to the list of drivers you want to include in
           the 16 colour server.

         o Set XF86Vga2Drivers to the list of drivers you want to include in
           the monochrome vga server.

         o Set XF86MonoDrivers to the list of non-vga mono drivers you want
           to include in the mono or VGA16 servers (when building dual-headed
           servers).

         o Note: the ordering of drivers determines the order in which the
           probing is done.  The `generic' driver should be the last one
           included in the Mono and VGA16 and SVGA servers because its probe
           always succeeds.

         o To use dynamically loadable modules(e.g. PEX, XIE): set Exten-
           sionsDynamicModules to YES.

         o To include the PEX extension: set BuildPexExt to YES.

         o To include the X Image Extension: set BuildXIE to YES.

         o To include the GLX Extension: set BuildGlxExt to YES.

         o To exclude the Double Buffer Extension: set BuildDBE to NO.

         o To exclude the Record Extension: set BuildRECORD to NO.

         o To exclude the Screen Saver extension: set BuildScreenSaverExt to
           NO.

         o Although it is possible to disable other extensions through this
           mechanism, doing so is not recommended because savings in server
           size are not appreciable, or the resulting server might even be
           crippled in some way.

  4.  If you are including a driver that it not part of the standard distri-
      bution, make a directory in drivers/vga256 (drivers/vga2 if it is for
      the VGA2 part of the Mono server, drivers/vga16 if it is for the 16
      colour server, or drivers/mono non-VGA part of the Mono and VGA16
      servers) and copy either the source or .o file and a suitable Imakefile
      into that directory.  The name of the directory should be the same as
      the name of the driver (refer to the documentation in the VGADriverDoc
      directory for more details).

  5.  To build the Makefile, run

             ./mkmf

  6.  Run `make' to link the server(s) as configured.

  7.  Run `make install' to install the new server(s).

  8.  Run `make clean' to remove the files that were created by this proce-
      dure.

  9.  If you edit the xf86site.def file and change the selection of servers
      being built or the drivers included in them, repeat the above proce-
      dure.  If changing the selection of Xserver extensions being included
      it is sufficient to run `make Makefile' instead of `./mkmf'.

 10.  It is possible to see which drivers are included in the Xserver by run-
      ning it with the `-showconfig' flag.  To check which extensions are
      included, start the Xserver and run `xdpyinfo'.
