The following is a list of files/directories required when using a
cut-down source tree to build only the X servers.  When using this
cut-down tree, set BuildServersOnly to YES and XnestServer to NO in
xc/config/cf/xf86site.def.

xc/Imakefile
xc/Makefile
xc/Makefile.ini
xc/RELNOTES.TXT
xc/bug-report
xc/config/
xc/include/
xc/lib/Imakefile
xc/lib/X11/
xc/lib/Xau/
xc/lib/Xdmcp/
xc/lib/font/
xc/lib/xtrans/
xc/programs/Imakefile
xc/programs/Xserver/Xserver.man
xc/programs/Xserver/Imakefile
xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/
xc/programs/Xserver/cfb/
xc/programs/Xserver/cfb16/
xc/programs/Xserver/cfb32/
xc/programs/Xserver/dix/
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/
xc/programs/Xserver/include/
xc/programs/Xserver/mfb/
xc/programs/Xserver/mi/
xc/programs/Xserver/os/
xc/registry

To include PEX support in the server, the following directory is also required:

xc/programs/Xserver/PEX

To include XIE support in the server, the following directory is also required:

xc/programs/Xserver/XIE


Notes:

1. the Xnest server cannot be built with this cut-down tree since it
requires libX11.

2. To get a cut-down source tree when starting form the full source tree,
do the following:

cd xc
rm -fr doc fonts test util
rm -fr lib/FS lib/ICE lib/PEX5 lib/SM lib/XIE
rm -fr lib/Xaw lib/Xbsd lib/Xext lib/Xi lib/Xmu lib/Xt lib/Xtst lib/oldX
rm -fr programs/[a-z]*
rm -fr programs/Xserver/hw/[a-wy-z]*

3. To start the build, run:

  make World

For some OSs you need to set BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS.  Refer to the appropriate
OS-specific README for information about this.
