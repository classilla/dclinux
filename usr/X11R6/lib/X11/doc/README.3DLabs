1.  Supported hardware

This server supports the following 3DLabs chipsets:

   o GLINT 500TX with IBM RGB526 RAMDAC

   o GLINT MX plus Delta with IBM RGB526 and IBM RGB640 RAMDAC

   o GLINT MX plus Gamma with IBM RGB526 and IBM RGB640 RAMDAC

   o Permedia with IBM RGB526 RAMDAC

   o Permedia 2 (classic, 2a, 2v)

2.  Features

   o accelerated

   o hardware cursor

   o DPMS support

   o supported color depths

        o GLINT MX/500TX: 8/16/32 bpp

        o Permedia: 8/16/32 bpp

        o Permedia 2: 8/16/24/32 bpp

3.  XF86Config Option

      Option "sw_cursor"
            disable the hardware cursor.

      Option "no_pixmap_cache"
            disables use of the pixmap cache. Might be useful if drawing
            errors occur.

      Option "no_accel"
            completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.

      Option "pci_retry"
            stall the PCI bus while the graphics engine is busy. While this
            might give slightly higher performance, you run the risk of dis-
            turbing other devices that are waiting to be serviced by the pro-
            cessor. This option may cause problems with SCSI cards, serial
            connections, sound cards, etc.

      Option "firegl_3000"
            needed for the Diamond Fire GL 3000 in order to use the primary
            output on that card. The second screen is currently not sup-
            ported.

      Option "overclock_mem"
            Run the memory at a higher clock. Useful on some cards with dis-
            play glitches at higher resolutions. But adds the risk to damage
            the hardware. Use with caution.

      Option "sync_on_green"
            Composite sync on green. Possibly useful if you wish to use an
            old workstation monitor. This feature is only implemented for
            Permedia 2 based boards (Permedia 2v doesn't have this capabil-
            ity). Default is to use positive sync polarity. As many SOG moni-
            tor want negative sync polarity, you'll have to play around with
            the "-HSync" and "-VSync" Modeline flags if you own such a moni-
            tor.

4.  Bugs and Limitations

   o The 500TX and MX chipsets cannot switch modes, therefore only the first
     mode on the modes line is available.

   o In some color depths without acceleration there are color problems.

   o While the server is accelerated, there is room for improvement. As our
     development is focusing on XFree86-4.0 we are not planning to change
     that in the 3.3.x branch. XFree86-4.0 will include a significantly
     faster server.

   o Special thanks to Elsa AG, Aachen for making it possible for us to
     develop this server and furnishing us with plenty of boards and informa-
     tion to help us on the way

   o Very special thanks to SuSE GmbH, Nuernberg for allowing some of us to
     work on this server on paid time, thereby financing development of this
     server.
