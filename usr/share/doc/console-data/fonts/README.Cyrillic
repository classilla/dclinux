Cyrillic fonts:

Type A. Alt

[Reference: codepage 866 (as given in Unicode 1.0, Vol 2, Appendix C).]
The Alt fonts have the Cyrillic letters in the ranges
0200-0237: capitals, 0240-0257,0340-0357: lower case,
0360-0367: some additional letters.

Here we have the alt* fonts (except that the positions 0362-0367 do not
carry upper and lower case e, yi, short u).
However, altc has some additional slavic characters
(and fewer line drawing characters).

Cyr_a8xN follows cp866 in the positions 0200-0257 and
0340-0357. This means that upper and lower case io
(cp866 codes 0360, 0361) are also missing.


Type B. Koi8

[Reference: RFC 1489]

The koi8* fonts are the koi8 equivalents of the alt*
fonts above; in particular, koi8c-8x16 also has
additional slavic characters.

koi8-14.psf follows koi8 in the positions 0300-0377
(and has some iso-8859-5 symbols in 0240-0277,
and yat, fita, izhitsa in 0200-0202, 0220-0222).
In particular, it does not have the io and IO at
0243, 0263.


Type C. ISO 8859-5

iso05.fN precisely follows iso-8859-5 in all positions
where that norm defines a symbol.
It has no symbols in the range 0200-0237.

880.cp follows iso-8859-5 in the positions 0240-0377
except that the four symbols 0244, 0364, 0371, 0372
[Ukrainian Cyrillic letter ie (upper and lower case),
and Cyrillic small letter lje, nje] are missing.
It has a few old Russian symbols in the range 0200-0202,
0220-222 (yat, fita, izhitsa).
Thus, in spite of its name it has very little to do
with the ibm cp880 (as described in GNU recode).
