This is the Linux NFS utility package version 0.3.1.

The nfs-utils package is available via the Linux NFS web page is at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nfs/

To compile, just do

# ./configure
# make

# make install

will install the nfs-utils binaries. You have to install the NFS
service scripts. There are 2 in etc/redhat provided for RedHat 6.x
and 7.0. They are tested on RedHat 6.2 and 7.0.

On RedHat 6.2 and 7.0, you can use

# rpm -ta nfs-utils-0.3.1.tar.gz

to build the source and binary RPMs.

util-linux 2.10m or above is required. But the following patches may
also be needed:

ftp://nfs.sourceforge.net/pub/nfs/util-linux-2.10m-mount-compat.patch
ftp://nfs.sourceforge.net/pub/nfs/util-linux-2.10m-mount-nfsv3.patch
