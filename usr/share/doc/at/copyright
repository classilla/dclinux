This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the deferred
execution scheduler called at.

This package was debianized by its author Thomas Koenig
<ig25@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>, taken over and re-packaged first by Martin
Schulze <joey@debian.org> and now by Siggy Brentrup <bsb@winnegan.de>.
This may be considered the experimental upstream source.
