Linux Manpages for Debian
-------------------------

These man pages are distributed under a variety of copyright licenses. 
Although these licenses permit free distribution of the nroff sources
contained in this package, commercial distribution may impose other
requirements (e.g., acknowledgement of copyright or inclusion of the raw
nroff sources with the commercial distribution). If you distribute these man
pages commercially, it is your responsibility to figure out your
obligations.  (For many man pages, these obligations require you to
distribute nroff sources with any pre-formatted man pages that you provide.)
Each file that contains nroff source for a man page also contains the
author(s) name, email address, and copyright notice.
