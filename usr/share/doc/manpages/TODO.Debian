Although there a lots of manpages included here, some are still missing.
If you're familiar with programming or libc source or if you're
interested to learn anything about libc and how it works it would
be a good idea trying to form a manual page for the following topics.
If you have done so, please send the completed page either
to Nicolás Lichtmaier <nick@feedback.com.ar> or to
Andries Brouwer <aeb@cwi.nl>.
