	w3m: WWW wo Miru Tool  version beta-990323
		(C) Copyright by Akinori ITO	March 23, 1999

1. Introduction

     w3m is a pager with WWW capability. It IS a pager, but it can be
used as a text-mode WWW browser.

     The features of w3m are as follows:

* When reading HTML document, you can follow links and view images
  (using external image viewer).
* It has 'internet message mode', which determines the type of document
  from header. If the Content-Type: field of the document is text/html,
  that document is displayed as HTML document.
* You can change URL description like 'http://hogege.net' in plain text
  into link to that URL.

Current problems are:

* Resize behaviour is imcomplete.
* It can't show images inline. (It seems to be impossible as far as using
  xterm)
* It doesn't decode MIME-body of the document.
* Online manuals are poor.

w3m is known to work on these platforms.

2.1 Run configure. The script will ask you a few questions. Answer them.
2.2 do make
2.3 do make install

MACHINE/OS specific notices:

HP-UX
	If you want to use HP C compiler, answer

		Input your favorite C-compiler.
		(Default: cc) cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE

	If you use just 'cc' without options, you can't compile w3m.
	If you are using gcc, no option is needed. 

OS/2
	You can compile w3m using emx. First you have to do
	is to compile GC library with

		cd gc
		make -f EMX_MAKEFILE

	then compile w3m. I heard that OS/2 console can't 
	display color, you had better compile w3m without
	color capability.

Windows
	See README.cygwin.

MS-DOS
	See README.dj.
