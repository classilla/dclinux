Please read the  README  file for detailed information about what needs to
be done to install the ADDUSER Local System Additions program.  In brief:

# cp ./adduser.local /usr/local/sbin
# cp ./adduser.local.conf /etc
# editor /etc/adduser.local.conf         # The important step!
# mkdir /etc/skel.other
# cp ./examples/skel.other/index.html /etc/skel.other

IMPORTANT: Do  NOT  just perform the above steps  without knowing what you
are doing!  In particular,  the third step is very important for you to do
correctly.
