This is Debian GNU's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU DBM
routines.

This package was put together by Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>,
from the GNU sources:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz

It was previosly maintained by Mark W. Eichin
<eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us> and Christoph Lameter <clameter@debian.org>.
It is currently being maintained by James Troup <james@nocrew.org>.
The changes were minimal:

o adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.  
o Makefile.in: drop tndbm, tdbm, since when we're bootstrapping the
  library there *aren't* native libs. (Should be tied into autoconf
  tests better.)
o configure: recreated via autoconf for no good reason (was trying to
  solve a build problem on m68k which actually turned out to be a
  problem with libc5-altdev).  
o configure.in: updated some of the obsolete macro's (same reason).
o gdbm.texinfo: remove two references to /usr/local/ that do not apply
                to Debian GNU.
