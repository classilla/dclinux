<P>This is a placeholder page installed by the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>
release of the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> Web server package,
because no home page was installed on this host. You may want to replace
this as soon as possible with your own web pages, of course....

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This computer has installed the Debian GNU/Linux operating system but has
nothing to do with the Debian GNU/Linux project.  If you want to
report something about this host's behavour or domain, please contact the
ISPs involved directly, <strong>not</strong> the Debian Project.
<P>See the <A HREF="http://www.abuse.net/">Network Abuse Clearinghouse</A>
for how to do this.

<P>Unless you changed its configuration, your new server is configured as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Configuration files can be found in <TT>/etc/apache</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>DocumentRoot</TT>, which is the directory under which all your
HTML files should exist, is set to <TT>/var/www</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
CGI scripts are looked for in <TT>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</TT>, which is where
Debian packages will place their scripts.</LI>

<LI>
Log files are placed in <TT>/var/log/apache</TT>, and will be rotated
daily.  The frequency of rotation can be easily changed by editing
<TT>/etc/apache/cron.conf</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
The default directory index is <TT>index.html</TT>, meaning that requests
for a directory <TT>/foo/bar/</TT> will give the contents of the file <TT>/var/www/foo/bar/index.html</TT>
if it exists (assuming that <TT>/var/www</TT> is your <TT>DocumentRoot</TT>).</LI>

<LI>
User directories are enabled, and user documents will be looked for in
the <TT>public_html</TT> directory of the users' homes.  These dirs
should be under /home, and users will not be able to symlink to files
they don't own.</LI>

</UL>
All standard Apache modules are available with this release and can be
chosen with the <TT>apacheconfig</TT> script. Installing a new module on
your system is just a matter of compiling it (with the apache-dev package)
and adding a line to your <TT>httpd.conf</TT> configuration file.

<P>More documentation on Apache can be found on:
<UL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="/doc/apache/">Apache documentation</A> stored on your server.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Project</A> home site.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.apacheweek.com/">ApacheWeek</A> newsletter.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/">Debian Project
Documentation</A> which contains HOWTOs, FAQs, and software updates.</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can also consult the list of <A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/faq/">World
Wide Web Frequently Asked Questions</A> for information.

<P>If you find a bug in this Apache package, or in Apache itself,
please file a bug report on it.  Instructions on doing this, and the
list of <A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/apache">known bugs</A> of this
package, can be found in the <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking System</A>.

<P>Thanks for using this package, and congratulations for your choice of
a Debian system!
