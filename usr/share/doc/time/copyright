This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU time utility.
`time' is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as time and
memory, that other programs use. It was written by David MacKenzie.

This package was put together by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> from the
previous Debian package time-1.6-2 (from ftp.debian.org) and the GNU sources
for time-1.6 (from ftp.cs.ubc.ca/mirror2/gnu, a mirror of ftp.gnu.org).
Changes are the Debian package maintenance system and a small patch to the
configure script.
