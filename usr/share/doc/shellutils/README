This is a package of small shell programming utilities.  They are mostly
compliant with POSIX.2, where applicable.

The programs that can be built with this package are:

  basename chroot date dirname echo env expr factor false groups
  hostname id logname nice nohup pathchk printenv printf pwd seq
  sleep stty su tee test true tty uname users who whoami yes

Some programs (chroot, nice, nohup, uname, and stty) are built and
installed only on systems that have the features to support them.
su is always built, but it is installed only if the installer can
create setuid-root programs.

If you want to install the su program separately, you can run
`./configure && make check && make install' as usual;  that will
install all programs except su if you installed as a non-privileged
user.  Then run `make install-root' as root to install only su.

If you want to enable logging of successful and failed su-to-root
invocations, you should run configure like this:

  env CFLAGS='-DSYSLOG_SUCCESS -DSYSLOG_FAILURE' ./configure

If you want to log attempts to su to non-root accounts also, add
-DSYSLOG_NON_ROOT.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

nice, stty, and uname require facilities not available on all systems;
`configure' detects this and does not try to compile them on systems
where those facilities are missing.
nohup requires nice.
su will be installed only if you do `make install' as root.

Many thanks to all of the people who have taken the time to submit
problem reports and fixes.  Contributed changes are attributed in the
ChangeLog file.

Note that the man pages are now automatically generated from templates
and from the --help usage message.  Patches to the template files (man/*.x)
are welcome.  However, the authoritative documentation is in texinfo form
in the doc directory.

These programs all recognize the `--version' option.  When reporting
bugs, please include in the subject line both the package name/version
and the name of the program for which you found a problem.
