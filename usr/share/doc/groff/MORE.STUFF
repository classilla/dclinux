plot2dev

This utility program can convert plot graphics to either pic or gremlin
files.  It has been written by Richard Murphey <richard-murphey@rice.edu>
and Daniel Senderowicz <daniel@synchrods.com> (who has added the gremlin

  ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/groff/plot2dev-x.x.tar.gz

miscellaneous
-------------

. Dr. Robert Hermann's groff gems are available from

    http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/RBHerrmann/GROFF/index.html

  At present there are examples for

  o creating business cards
  o using groff to make large format posters for presentations

. Robert Marks's collection of useful macros and scripts is available from

    http://www.agsm.edu.au/~bobm/odds+ends/scripts.html

  Description:

  o `polish': Is a sed (= the Unix stream editor) script that does many
    things to ASCII text.  Amongst other things, it breaks lines at new
    sentences, reduces upper-case acronyms by one point size, adds
    diacriticals, changes simple quotes into smart quotes, and makes a few
    simple grammar checks.  The best way to see what it does is to run it as
    a sed script file (or files) on a text file and then compare the output
    file with the original.

  o `DropCaps' is a troff script which replaces the initial letters of
    paragraphs immediately after H1 and H2 headings with drop-capitals of
    specified point size, and automatically flows the text around the new
    drop cap.

  o `AJM Header' is a set of troff macros used in production of the
    Australian Journal of Management.  They use the Memorandum Macros (mm)
    of AT&T, and so should be invoked with the UNIX troff -mm flag; they
    should also work with the GNU troff -mm flag.
