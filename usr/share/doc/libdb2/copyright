Copyright information.

Attached below you'll find the copyright notice and license found in 
the sources tree.

About it, Sleepycat Software Inc. says:

	Complete source code for Berkeley DB is provided as part of
	the package, and DB may be freely redistributed and used
	under most non-commercial conditions.  This license is
	different from the one used for the DB 1.85 release.  The
	major difference is that the license for DB 2.0 requires that,
	if the DB software is to be redistributed, the software using
	DB 2.0 must also be freely redistributed.

	Therefore you can't redistribute the db2 libraries as part of a
	program for which the source is not freely redistributable, using
	the present license.

	The reason is that we want it to be clear that you can freely use
	DB internally without having to redistribute your sources.  The
	only folks we ask to commercially license DB are people that are
	redistributing DB and not redistributing their source.
