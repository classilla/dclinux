<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>form_field_opts</B> - set and get field options


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;form.h&gt;</B>
       int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, OPTIONS opts);
       int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, OPTIONS opts);
       int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, OPTIONS opts);
       OPTIONS field_opts(const FIELD *field);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  function  <B>set_field_opts</B>  sets  all the given field's
       option bits (field  option  bits  may  be  logically-OR'ed
       together).

       The function <B>field_opts_on</B> turns on the given option bits,
       and leaves others alone.

       The function <B>field_opts_off</B> turns  off  the  given  option
       bits, and leaves others alone.

       The function <B>field_opts</B> returns the field's current option
       bits.

       The following options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_VISIBLE
            The  field is displayed.  If this option is off, dis-
            play of the field is suppressed,

       O_ACTIVE
            The field is  visited  during  processing.   If  this
            option  is  off,  the  field will not be reachable by
            navigation keys.  Please  notice  that  an  invisible
            field appears to be inactive also.

       O_PUBLIC
            The  field contents are displayed as data is entered.

       O_EDIT
            The field can be edited.

       O_WRAP
            Words that don't fit on a line  are  wrapped  to  the
            next line.  Words are blank-separated.

       O_BLANK
            The  field is cleared whenever a character is entered
            at the first position.

       O_AUTOSKIP
            Skip to the next field when this one fills


       O_NULLOK
            Allow a blank field.

       O_STATIC
            Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.

       O_PASSOK
            Validate field only if modified by user.


</PRE>

       Except for <B>field_opts</B>, each routine  returns  one  of  the
       following:

       <B>E_OK</B> The routine succeeded.
