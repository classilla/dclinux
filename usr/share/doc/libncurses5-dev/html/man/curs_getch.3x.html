<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>getch</B>, <B>wgetch</B>, <B>mvgetch</B> and <B>mvwgetch</B>, routines  read  a
       character  from the window.  In no-delay mode, if no input
       is waiting, the value <B>ERR</B> is returned.  In delay mode, the
       program  waits until the system passes text through to the
       program.  Depending on the  setting  of  <B>cbreak</B>,  this  is
       after one character (cbreak mode), or after the first new-
       line (nocbreak mode).  In  half-delay  mode,  the  program
       waits  until a character is typed or the specified timeout
       has been reached.

       Unless <B>noecho</B> has been set, then the character  will  also
       be echoed into the designated window according to the fol-
       lowing rules: If the character is the current erase  char-
       acter,  left  arrow, or backspace, the cursor is moved one
       space to the left and that screen position is erased as if
       <B>delch</B>  had  been  called.   If  the character value is any
       other <B>KEY_</B> define, the user is alerted with a  <B>beep</B>  call.
       Otherwise the character is simply output to the screen.

       If the window is not a pad, and it has been moved or modi-
       fied since the last call to  <B>wrefresh</B>,  <B>wrefresh</B>  will  be
       called before another character is read.

       If  <B>keypad</B>  is  <B>TRUE</B>,  and  a function key is pressed, the
       token for that function key is returned instead of the raw
       characters.    Possible   function  keys  are  defined  in
       <B>&lt;curses.h&gt;</B> as macros with  values  outside  the  range  of
       8-bit  characters  whose  names  begin  with <B>KEY_.</B> Thus, a
       variable intended to hold the return value of  a  function
       key must be of short size or larger.

       When a character that could be the beginning of a function
       key is received (which,  on  modern  terminals,  means  an
       escape  character), <B>curses</B> sets a timer.  If the remainder
       of the sequence does not come  in  within  the  designated
       time,  the  character  is  passed  through; otherwise, the
       function key value is returned.   For  this  reason,  many
       terminals  experience  a  delay  between  the  time a user
       presses the escape key and the escape is returned  to  the
       program.

       The <B>ungetch</B> routine places <I>ch</I> back onto the input queue to
       be returned by the next call to <B>wgetch</B>.  Note  that  there
       is, in effect, just one input queue for all windows.


   <B>Function</B> <B>Keys</B>
       The  following function keys, defined in <B>&lt;curses.h&gt;</B>, might
       be returned by <B>getch</B> if <B>keypad</B>  has  been  enabled.   Note
       that  not  all  of  these are necessarily supported on any
       particular terminal.

       Keypad is arranged like this:

                         +-----+------+-------+
                         | <B>A1</B>  |  <B>up</B>  |  <B>A3</B>   |
                         +-----+------+-------+
                         |<B>left</B> |  <B>B2</B>  | <B>right</B> |
                         +-----+------+-------+
                         | <B>C1</B>  | <B>down</B> |  <B>C3</B>   |
                         +-----+------+-------+
       The <B>has_key</B> routine takes a key value from the above list,
       and returns TRUE or FALSE according as the current  termi-
       nal type recognizes a key with that value.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All  routines  return  the integer <B>ERR</B> upon failure and an
       integer value other than <B>ERR</B> (<B>OK</B> in the case of ungetch())
       upon successful completion.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single charac-
       ter function is discouraged, as it will cause a  delay  of
       up to one second while the keypad code looks for a follow-
       ing function-key sequence.

       When using <B>getch</B>, <B>wgetch</B>, <B>mvgetch</B>, or  <B>mvwgetch</B>,  nocbreak
       mode (<B>nocbreak</B>) and echo mode (<B>echo</B>) should not be used at
       the same time.  Depending on the state of the  tty  driver
       when  each  character  is  typed,  the program may produce
       undesirable results.

       Note that <B>getch</B>, <B>mvgetch</B>, and <B>mvwgetch</B> may be macros.

       Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined
       by  the  extremely  function-key-rich keyboard of the AT&amp;T
       7300, aka 3B1, aka Safari 4.   Modern  personal  computers
       usually  have  only a small subset of these.  IBM PC-style
       consoles  typically  support  little  more  than   <B>KEY_UP</B>,
       <B>KEY_DOWN</B>,    <B>KEY_LEFT</B>,   <B>KEY_RIGHT</B>,   <B>KEY_HOME</B>,   <B>KEY_END</B>,
       <B>KEY_NPAGE</B>, <B>KEY_PPAGE</B>, and function keys 1 through 12.  The
       Ins key is usually mapped to <B>KEY_IC</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  *get* functions are described in the XSI Curses stan-
       dard, Issue 4.  They  read  single-byte  characters  only.
       The  standard  specifies  that they return <B>ERR</B> on failure,
       but specifies no error conditions.

       The echo behavior of these functions on input of  <B>KEY_</B>  or
       backspace  characters  was not specified in the SVr4 docu-
       mentation.  This  description  is  adopted  from  the  XSI
       Curses standard.

       The  behavior of <B>getch</B> and friends in the presence of han-
       dled signals is unspecified in the  SVr4  and  XSI  Curses
       documentation.   Under  historical curses implementations,
       it varied depending  on  whether  the  operating  system's
       implementation  of  handled  signal  receipt  interrupts a
       <B><A HREF="read.2.html">read(2)</A></B> call in progress or not, and also (in some  imple-
       mentations)  depending on whether an input timeout or non-
       blocking mode hsd been set.

       Programmers concerned about portability should be prepared
       for  either  of  two  cases:  (a)  signal receipt does not
       interrupt <B>getch</B>; (b) signal receipt interrupts  <B>getch</B>  and
       causes  it  to  return ERR with <B>errno</B> set to <B>EINTR</B>.  Under
       the <B>ncurses</B> implementation, handled signals  never  inter-
       rupt <B>getch</B>.

       The  <B>has_key</B>  function is unique to <B>ncurses</B>.  We recommend
       that  any  code  using  it  be  conditionalized   on   the
       <B>NCURSES_VERSION</B> feature macro.
