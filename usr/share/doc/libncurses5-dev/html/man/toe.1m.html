<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>toe</B> - table of (terminfo) entries


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>toe</B> [<B>-v</B>[<I>n</I>]] [<B>-huUV</B>] <I>file...</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       With no options, <B>toe</B> lists all available terminal types by
       primary name with descriptions.   File  arguments  specify
       the  directories  to  be scanned; if no such arguments are
       given, your default terminfo directory is scanned.  If you
       also  specify  the  -h  option, a directory header will be
       issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo  file
       maintainers:

       <B>-u</B> <I>file</I>
              says to issue a report on dependencies in the given
              file. This report  condenses  the  `use'  relation:
              each  line consists of the primary name of a termi-
              nal that has use capabilities, followed by a colon,
              followed  by the whitespace-separated primary names
              of all terminals which occur in those use capabili-
              ties, followed by a newline

       <B>-U</B> <I>file</I>
              says  to  issue a report on reverse dependencies in
              the given file.  This  report  reverses  the  `use'
              relation: each line consists of the primary name of
              a terminal that occurs in  use  capabilities,  fol-
              lowed  by a colon, followed by the whitespace-sepa-
              rated primary names of all terminals  which  depend
              on it, followed by a newline.

       <B>-v</B><I>n</I>    specifies that (verbose) output be written to stan-
              dard  error   trace   information   showing   <B>toe</B>'s
              progress.   The optional integer <I>n</I> is a number from
              1 to 10, interpreted as for <B><A HREF="tic.1.html">tic(1)</A></B>.

       <B>-V</B>   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
            program, and exits.
