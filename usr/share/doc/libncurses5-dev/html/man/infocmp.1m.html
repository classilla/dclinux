<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>infocmp</B>  can  be  used  to compare a binary <B>terminfo</B> entry
       with other terminfo entries, rewrite a  <B>terminfo</B>  descrip-
       tion  to  take  advantage  of  the <B>use=</B> terminfo field, or
       print out a <B>terminfo</B>  description  from  the  binary  file
       (<B>term</B>) in a variety of formats.  In all cases, the boolean
       fields will be printed  first,  followed  by  the  numeric
       fields, followed by the string fields.

   <B>Default</B> <B>Options</B>
       If  no options are specified and zero or one <I>termnames</I> are
       specified, the <B>-I</B> option will be assumed.   If  more  than
       one  <I>termname</I> is specified, the <B>-d</B> option will be assumed.

   <B>Comparison</B> <B>Options</B> <B>[-d]</B> <B>[-c]</B> <B>[-n]</B>
       <B>infocmp</B> compares the <B>terminfo</B>  description  of  the  first
       terminal  <I>termname</I>  with each of the descriptions given by
       the entries for the  other  terminal's  <I>termnames</I>.   If  a
       capability  is  defined for only one of the terminals, the
       value returned will depend on the type of the  capability:
       <B>F</B>  for  boolean  variables,  <B>-1</B> for integer variables, and
       <B>NULL</B> for string variables.

       The <B>-d</B> option produces a list of each capability  that  is
       different  between  two entries.  This option is useful to
       show the difference between two entries, created  by  dif-
       ferent people, for the same or similar terminals.

       The  <B>-c</B>  option produces a list of each capability that is
       common between two entries.  Capabilities that are not set
       are  ignored.  This option can be used as a quick check to
       see if the <B>-u</B> option is worth using.

       The <B>-n</B> option produces a list of each capability  that  is
       in neither entry.  If no <I>termnames</I> are given, the environ-
       ment variable <B>TERM</B> will be used for both of the <I>termnames</I>.
       This  can  be used as a quick check to see if anything was
       left out of a description.

   <B>Source</B> <B>Listing</B> <B>Options</B> <B>[-I]</B> <B>[-L]</B> <B>[-C]</B> <B>[-r]</B>
       The <B>-I</B>, <B>-L</B>, and <B>-C</B> options will produce a  source  listing
       for each terminal named.

      <B>-I</B>   use the <B>terminfo</B> names
      <B>-L</B>   use the long C variable name listed in &lt;<B>term.h</B>&gt;

      <B>-C</B>   use the <B>termcap</B> names
      <B>-r</B>   when using <B>-C</B>, put out all capabilities in <B>termcap</B> form

       If  no  <I>termnames</I> are given, the environment variable <B>TERM</B>
       will be used for the terminal name.

       The source produced by the <B>-C</B> option may be used  directly
       as  a <B>termcap</B> entry, but not all parameterized strings can
       be changed to the <B>termcap</B> format.  <B>infocmp</B> will attempt to
       convert  most  of  the parameterized information, and any-
       thing not converted will be plainly marked in  the  output
       and commented out.  These should be edited by hand.

       All  padding  information  for  strings  will be collected
       together and placed at the beginning of the  string  where
       <B>termcap</B>  expects  it.  Mandatory padding (padding informa-
       tion with a trailing '/') will become optional.

       All <B>termcap</B> variables no longer supported by <B>terminfo</B>, but
       which are derivable from other <B>terminfo</B> variables, will be
       output.  Not all <B>terminfo</B> capabilities will be translated;
       only  those variables which were part of <B>termcap</B> will nor-
       mally be output.  Specifying the <B>-r</B> option will  take  off
       this  restriction,  allowing all capabilities to be output
       in <I>termcap</I> form.

       Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of
       the  capability,  not all capabilities are output.  Manda-
       tory padding is not supported.   Because  <B>termcap</B>  strings
       are  not as flexible, it is not always possible to convert
       a <B>terminfo</B> string capability into  an  equivalent  <B>termcap</B>
       format.   A subsequent conversion of the <B>termcap</B> file back
       into <B>terminfo</B> format will not  necessarily  reproduce  the
       original <B>terminfo</B> source.

       Some  common  <B>terminfo</B>  parameter sequences, their <B>termcap</B>
       equivalents, and some terminal types which  commonly  have
       such sequences, are:

     <B>terminfo</B>                    <B>termcap</B>   Representative Terminals

   <B>Use=</B> <B>Option</B> <B>[-u]</B>
       The  <B>-u</B>  option  produces a <B>terminfo</B> source description of
       the first terminal <I>termname</I> which is relative to  the  sum
       of  the  descriptions  given  by the entries for the other
       terminals <I>termnames</I>.  It does this by analyzing  the  dif-
       ferences   between   the  first  <I>termname</I>  and  the  other
       <I>termnames</I> and producing a description with <B>use=</B> fields for
       the  other  terminals.   In this manner, it is possible to
       retrofit  generic  terminfo  entries  into  a   terminal's
       description.  Or, if two similar terminals exist, but were
       coded at different times or by different  people  so  that
       each description is a full description, using <B>infocmp</B> will
       show what can be done to change one description to be rel-
       ative to the other.

       A capability will get printed with an at-sign (@) if it no
       longer exists in the first <I>termname</I>, but one of the  other
       <I>termname</I>  entries contains a value for it.  A capability's
       value gets printed if the value in the first  <I>termname</I>  is
       not  found in any of the other <I>termname</I> entries, or if the
       first of the other <I>termname</I> entries that has this capabil-
       ity  gives  a different value for the capability than that
       in the first <I>termname</I>.

       The order of the other <I>termname</I>  entries  is  significant.
       Since  the terminfo compiler <B>tic</B> does a left-to-right scan
       of the capabilities, specifying two <B>use=</B> entries that con-
       tain differing entries for the same capabilities will pro-
       duce different results depending on  the  order  that  the
       entries  are  given in.  <B>infocmp</B> will flag any such incon-
       sistencies between the other <I>termname</I> entries as they  are
       found.

       Alternatively,  specifying a capability <I>after</I> a <B>use=</B> entry
       that contains that capability will cause the second speci-
       fication  to  be  ignored.   Using  <B>infocmp</B>  to recreate a
       description can be a useful check to make sure that every-
       thing  was  specified  correctly  in  the  original source
       description.

       Another error  that  does  not  cause  incorrect  compiled
       files,  but will slow down the compilation time, is speci-
       fying extra <B>use=</B> fields  that  are  superfluous.   <B>infocmp</B>
       will  flag  any  other  <I>termname</I> <I>use=</I> fields that were not
       needed.

   <B>Changing</B> <B>Databases</B> <B>[-A</B> <I>directory</I>] [-B <I>directory</I>]
       The location of the compiled <B>terminfo</B>  database  is  taken
       from  the environment variable <B>TERMINFO</B> .  If the variable
       is not defined, or the terminal is not found in that loca-
       tion,  the  system  <B>terminfo</B>  database, in <B>/usr/share/ter-</B>
       <B>minfo</B>, will be used.  The options <B>-A</B> and <B>-B</B> may be used to
       override  this  location.  The <B>-A</B> option will set <B>TERMINFO</B>
       for the first <I>termname</I> and the <B>-B</B> option will set <B>TERMINFO</B>
       for  the  other  <I>termnames</I>.   With this, it is possible to
       compare descriptions for a terminal  with  the  same  name
       located  in  two  different databases.  This is useful for
       comparing descriptions for the same  terminal  created  by
       different people.

   <B>Other</B>  <B>Options</B>  <B>[-s</B> <B>d|i|l|c]</B> <B>[-1FTVefip]</B> <B>[-Rsubset]</B> <B>[-v</B> <I>n</I>] [-w
       <I>width</I>]
       The <B>-s</B> option sorts the fields within each type  according
       to the argument below:

       <B>d</B>    leave fields in the order that they are stored in the
            <I>terminfo</I> database.

       <B>i</B>    sort by <I>terminfo</I> name.

       <B>l</B>    sort by the long C variable name.

       <B>c</B>    sort by the <I>termcap</I> name.

            If the <B>-s</B> option is not given, the fields printed out
            will  be  sorted  alphabetically by the <B>terminfo</B> name
            within each type, except in the case of the <B>-C</B> or the
            <B>-L</B> options, which cause the sorting to be done by the
            <B>termcap</B> name or the long  C  variable  name,  respec-
            tively.

       <B>-1</B>   causes  the  fields  to be printed out one to a line.
            Otherwise, the fields will be printed  several  to  a
            line to a maximum width of 60 characters.

       <B>-F</B>   compare  terminfo  files.  This assumes that two fol-
            lowing  arguments  are  filenames.   The  files   are
            searched  for  pairwise matches between entries, with
            two entries considered to match if any of their names
            do.   The  report  printed  to  standard output lists
            entries with  no  matches  in  the  other  file,  and
            entries  with  more than one match.  For entries with
            exactly one match it includes  a  difference  report.
            Normally,  to  reduce  the  volume of the report, use
            references are not resolved before looking  for  dif-
            ferences, but resolution can be forced by also speci-
            fying <B>-r</B>.

       <B>-G</B>   Display constant literals in decimal form rather than
            their character equivalents.

       <B>-a</B>   tells  <B>infocmp</B>  to  retain commented-out capabilities
            rather than discarding them.  Capabilities  are  com-
            mented by prefixing them with a period.

       <B>-q</B>   Make  the comparison listing shorter by omitting sub-
            headings, and using "-" for absent capabilities,  "@"
            for canceled rather than "NULL".

       <B>-R</B><I>subset</I>
            Restrict  output  to  a given subset.  This option is
            for use with archaic versions of terminfo like  those
            on  SVr1,  Ultrix,  or  HP/UX that do not support the
            full set of SVR4/XSI Curses  terminfo;  and  variants
            such as AIX that have their own extensions incompati-
            ble with SVr4/XSI.  Available  terminfo  subsets  are
            "SVr1",  "Ultrix",  "HP",  and "AIX"; see <B><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></B>
            for details.  You can also choose  the  subset  "BSD"
            which  selects only capabilities with termcap equiva-
            lents recognized by 4.4BSD.

       <B>-T</B>   eliminates size-restrictions on the  generated  text.
            This is mainly useful for testing and analysis, since
            the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for
            termcap, 4096 for terminfo).

       <B>-V</B>   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
            program, and exits.

       <B>-e</B>   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal  as  a  C
            initializer  for  a  TERMTYPE structure (the terminal
            capability structure in the <B>&lt;term.h&gt;</B>).   This  option
            is  useful  for  preparing  versions  of  the  curses
            library hardwired for a given terminal type.

       <B>-E</B>   Dump  the  capabilities  of  the  given  terminal  as
            tables,  needed  in  the C initializer for a TERMTYPE
            structure (the terminal capability structure  in  the
            <B>&lt;term.h&gt;</B>).   This option is useful for preparing ver-
            sions of the curses library  hardwired  for  a  given
            terminal  type.   The tables are all declared static,
            and are named according to the type and the  name  of
            the corresponding terminal entry.

            Before  ncurses  5.0, the split between the <B>-e</B> and <B>-E</B>
            options was not  needed;  but  support  for  extended
            names required making the arrays of terminal capabil-
            ities separate from the TERMTYPE structure.

       <B>-f</B>   Display  complex  terminfo  strings   which   contain
            if/then/else/endif expressions indented for readabil-
            ity.

       <B>-g</B>   Display constant character literals  in  quoted  form
            rather than their decimal equivalents.

       <B>-i</B>   Analyze the initialization (<B>is1</B>, <B>is2</B>, <B>is3</B>), and reset
            (<B>rs1</B>, <B>rs2</B>, <B>rs3</B>), strings  in  the  entry.   For  each
            string,  the code tries to analyze it into actions in
            terms of the other capabilities in the entry, certain
            X3.64/ISO  6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain DEC
            VT-series private modes (the set of  recognized  spe-
            cial  sequences  has  been  selected for completeness
            over the existing terminfo  database).   Each  report
            line  consists  of the capability name, followed by a
            colon and space, followed by a printable expansion of
            the  capability  string with sections matching recog-
            nized   actions    translated    into    {}-bracketed
            descriptions.  Here is a list of the DEC/ANSI special
            sequences recognized:

            It also recognizes  a  SGR  action  corresponding  to
            ANSI/ISO  6429/ECMA  Set Graphics Rendition, with the
            values NORMAL, BOLD, UNDERLINE, BLINK,  and  REVERSE.
            All  but NORMAL may be prefixed with `+' (turn on) or
            `-' (turn off).

            An  SGR0  designates  an  empty  highlight   sequence
            (equivalent to {SGR:NORMAL}).

       <B>-p</B>   Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings.

       <B>-v</B> <I>n</I> prints out tracing information on standard  error  as
            the  program runs.  Higher values of n induce greater
            verbosity.

       <B>-w</B> <I>width</I>
            changes the output to <I>width</I> characters.
