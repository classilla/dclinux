</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>initscr</B>  is normally the first <B>curses</B> routine to call when
       initializing a program.  A few special routines  sometimes
       need  to  be called before it; these are <B>slk_init</B>, <B>filter</B>,
       <B>ripoffline</B>, <B>use_env</B>.  For multiple-terminal  applications,
       <B>newterm</B> may be called before <B>initscr</B>.

       The initscr code determines the terminal type and initial-
       izes all <B>curses</B> data structures.  <B>initscr</B> also causes  the
       first  call  to  <B>refresh</B>  to  clear the screen.  If errors
       occur, <B>initscr</B> writes  an  appropriate  error  message  to
       standard error and exits; otherwise, a pointer is returned
       to <B>stdscr</B>.

       A program that outputs to more than  one  terminal  should
       use  the  <B>newterm</B>  routine  for  each  terminal instead of
       <B>initscr</B>.  A program that needs to inspect capabilities, so
       it can continue to run in a line-oriented mode if the ter-
       minal cannot support a screen-oriented program, would also
       use  <B>newterm</B>.   The  routine <B>newterm</B> should be called once
       for each terminal.  It returns a variable of type <B>SCREEN</B> <B>*</B>
       which  should  be  saved  as a reference to that terminal.
       The arguments are the <I>type</I> of the terminal to be  used  in
       place of <B>$TERM</B>, a file pointer for output to the terminal,
       and another file pointer for input from the  terminal  (if
       <I>type</I>  is <B>NULL</B>, <B>$TERM</B> will be used).  The program must also
       call <B>endwin</B> for each terminal being  used  before  exiting
       from  <B>curses</B>.  If <B>newterm</B> is called more than once for the
       same terminal, the first terminal referred to must be  the
       last one for which <B>endwin</B> is called.

       A  program  should  always  call  <B>endwin</B> before exiting or
       escaping  from  <B>curses</B>  mode  temporarily.   This  routine
       restores  tty  modes,  moves the cursor to the lower left-
       hand corner of the screen and resets the terminal into the
       proper non-visual mode.  Calling <B>refresh</B> or <B>doupdate</B> after
       a temporary escape causes the  program  to  resume  visual
       mode.

       The  <B>isendwin</B>  routine  returns  <B>TRUE</B>  if  <B>endwin</B> has been
       called without any subsequent calls to <B>wrefresh</B>, and <B>FALSE</B>
       otherwise.

       The  <B>set_term</B>  routine is used to switch between different
       terminals.  The screen reference <B>new</B> becomes the new  cur-
       rent  terminal.   The previous terminal is returned by the
       routine.  This  is  the  only  routine  which  manipulates
       <B>SCREEN</B>  pointers;  all other routines affect only the cur-
       rent terminal.

       The <B>delscreen</B> routine frees storage  associated  with  the
       <B>SCREEN</B>  data  structure.   The  <B>endwin</B> routine does not do
       this, so <B>delscreen</B> should be called after <B>endwin</B> if a par-
       ticular <B>SCREEN</B> is no longer needed.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <B>endwin</B>  returns  the  integer <B>ERR</B> upon failure and <B>OK</B> upon
       successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers always return <B>NULL</B> on error.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <B>initscr</B> and <B>newterm</B> may be macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  functions are described in the XSI Curses standard,
       Issue 4.  It specifies that portable applications must not
       call <B>initscr</B> more than once.

       Old versions of curses, e.g., BSD 4.4, may have returned a
       null pointer from  <B>initscr</B>  when  an  error  is  detected,
       rather  than  exiting.   It is safe but redundant to check
       the return value of <B>initscr</B> in XSI Curses.
