<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Once a form has been posted (displayed), you should funnel
       input events to it through <B>form_driver</B>.  This routine  has
       two  major input cases; either the input is a form naviga-
       tion request or it's a  printable  ASCII  character.   The
       form driver requests are as follows:

       If the second argument is a printable ASCII character, the
       driver places it in the current position  in  the  current
       field.   If  it is one of the forms requests listed above,
       that request is executed.

       If the second argument is neither printable ASCII nor  one
       of the above pre-defined form requests, the driver assumes
       it  is  an  application-specific   command   and   returns
       <B>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</B>.  Application-defined commands should be
       defined relative to  <B>MAX_COMMAND</B>,  the  maximum  value  of
       these pre-defined requests.


</PRE>
