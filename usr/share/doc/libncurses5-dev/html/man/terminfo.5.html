       terminfo - terminal capability data base


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       /usr/share/terminfo/*/*


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Terminfo</I>  is  a  data  base  describing terminals, used by
       screen-oriented programs  such  as  <B><A HREF="nvi.1.html">nvi(1)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="rogue.1.html">rogue(1)</A></B>  and
       libraries  such  as <B><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3x)</A></B>.  <I>Terminfo</I> describes termi-
       nals by giving a set of capabilities which they  have,  by
       specifying how to perform screen operations, and by speci-
       fying padding requirements and initialization sequences.

       Entries in <I>terminfo</I> consist of a sequence of `,' separated
       fields  (embedded  commas may be escaped with a  backslash
       or notated as \072).  White space after the `,'  separator
       is  ignored.   The first entry for each terminal gives the
       names which are known for the terminal, separated  by  `|'
       characters.   The  first  name  given  is  the most common
       abbreviation for the terminal, the last name given  should
       be  a  long  name  fully identifying the terminal, and all
       others are understood as synonyms for the  terminal  name.
       All names but the last should be in lower case and contain
       no blanks; the last name may well contain upper  case  and
       blanks for readability.

       Terminal names (except for the last, verbose entry) should
       be chosen using the following conventions.  The particular
       piece  of  hardware  making  up the terminal should have a
       root name, thus ``hp2621''.  This name should not  contain
       hyphens.  Modes that the hardware can be in, or user pref-
       erences, should be indicated by appending a hyphen  and  a
       mode  suffix.   Thus,  a vt100 in 132 column mode would be
       vt100-w.  The following suffixes should be used where pos-
       sible:

      <B>Suffix</B>                  <B>Meaning</B>                   <B>Example</B>
      -<I>nn</I>      Number of lines on the screen            aaa-60
      -<I>n</I>p      Number of pages of memory                c100-4p
      -am      With automargins (usually the default)   vt100-am
      -m       Mono mode; suppress color                ansi-m
      -mc      Magic cookie; spaces when highlighting   wy30-mc
      -na      No arrow keys (leave them in local)      c100-na
      -nam     Without automatic margins                vt100-nam
      -nl      No status line                           att4415-nl
      -ns      No status line                           hp2626-ns
      -rv      Reverse video                            c100-rv
      -s       Enable status line                       vt100-s
      -vb      Use visible bell instead of beep         wy370-vb
      -w       Wide mode (&gt; 80 columns, usually 132)    vt100-w

       manual page.

   <B>Capabilities</B>
       The following is a  complete  table  of  the  capabilities
       included  in a terminfo description block and available to
       terminfo-using code.  In each line of the table,

       The <B>variable</B> is the name by which the programmer  (at  the
       terminfo level) accesses the capability.

       The  <B>capname</B>  is  the  short  name used in the text of the
       database, and is used by a person updating  the  database.
       Whenever  possible,  capnames are chosen to be the same as
       or similar to the ANSI X3.64-1979 standard (now superseded
       by  ECMA-48,  which uses identical or very similar names).
       Semantics are also intended to match those of the specifi-
       cation.

       The  termcap code is the old <B>termcap</B> capability name (some
       capabilities are new, and have names which termcap did not
       originate).

       Capability  names have no hard length limit, but an infor-
       mal limit of 5 characters has been adopted  to  keep  them
       short  and  to  allow  the tabs in the source file <B>Caps</B> to
       line up nicely.

       Finally, the description  field  attempts  to  convey  the
       semantics  of  the capability.  You may find some codes in
       the description field:

       (P)    indicates that padding may be specified

       #[1-9] in the description field indicates that the  string
              is passed through tparm with parms as given (#<I>i</I>).

       (P*)   indicates  that  padding  may vary in proportion to
              the number of lines affected

       (#<I>i</I>)   indicates the <I>i</I>th parameter.


       These are the boolean capabilities:

        invented; according to the XSI Curses standard, they have
        no termcap names.  If your compiled terminfo entries  use
        these,  they  may  not be binary-compatible with System V
        terminfo entries after SVr4.1; beware!

       Entries may continue onto multiple lines by placing  white
       space  at  the  beginning  of  each line except the first.
       Comments may be included on lines  beginning  with  ``#''.
       Capabilities in <I>terminfo</I> are of three types: Boolean capa-
       bilities which indicate that the terminal has some partic-
       ular  feature, numeric capabilities giving the size of the
       terminal or the size  of  particular  delays,  and  string
       capabilities,  which  give a sequence which can be used to
       perform particular terminal operations.


   <B>Types</B> <B>of</B> <B>Capabilities</B>
       All capabilities have names.  For instance, the fact  that
       ANSI-standard  terminals  have <I>automatic</I> <I>margins</I> (i.e., an
       automatic return and line-feed when the end of a  line  is
       reached)  is  indicated  by  the capability <B>am</B>.  Hence the
       description of ansi includes <B>am</B>.  Numeric capabilities are
       followed  by  the character `#' and then a positive value.
       Thus <B>cols</B>, which indicates the number of columns the  ter-
       minal  has,  gives  the  value  `80' for ansi.  Values for
       numeric capabilities may be specified in decimal, octal or
       hexadecimal,  using the C programming language conventions
       (e.g., 255, 0377 and 0xff or 0xFF).

       Finally, string valued capabilities, such as <B>el</B> (clear  to
       end of line sequence) are given by the two-character code,
       an `=', and then a string ending  at  the  next  following
       `,'.

       A  number  of  escape sequences are provided in the string
       valued capabilities for easy encoding of characters there.
       Both  <B>\E</B>  and  <B>\e</B> map to an ESCAPE character, <B>^x</B> maps to a
       control-x for any appropriate x, and the sequences  <B>\n</B>  <B>\l</B>
       <B>\r</B>  <B>\t</B>  <B>\b</B>  <B>\f</B>  <B>\s</B> give a newline, line-feed, return, tab,
       backspace, form-feed, and space.  Other escapes include <B>\^</B>
       for  <B>^</B>, <B>\\</B> for <B>\</B>, <B>\</B>, for comma, <B>\:</B> for <B>:</B>, and <B>\0</B> for null.
       (<B>\0</B> will produce \200, which does not terminate  a  string
       but behaves as a null character on most terminals, provid-
       ing CS7 is specified.  See <B><A HREF="stty.1.html">stty(1)</A></B>.)  Finally,  characters
       may be given as three octal digits after a <B>\</B>.

       A  delay  in  milliseconds may appear anywhere in a string
       capability, enclosed in $&lt;..&gt; brackets, as in  <B>el</B>=\EK$&lt;5&gt;,
       and  padding  characters  are supplied by <I>tputs</I> to provide
       this delay.  The delay must be a number with at  most  one
       decimal place of precision; it may be followed by suffixes
       `*' or '/' or both.  A  `*'  indicates  that  the  padding
       required  is  proportional to the number of lines affected
       by the  operation,  and  the  amount  given  is  the  per-
       affected-unit  padding  required.   (In the case of insert
       character,  the  factor  is  still  the  number  of  <I>lines</I>
       affected.)   Normally,  padding  is advisory if the device
       has the <B>xon</B> capability; it is used  for  cost  computation
       but  does not trigger delays.  A `/' suffix indicates that
       the padding is mandatory and forces a delay of  the  given
       number  of  milliseconds  even on devices for which <B>xon</B> is
       present to indicate flow control.

       Sometimes individual capabilities must be  commented  out.
       To  do this, put a period before the capability name.  For
       example, see the second <B>ind</B> in the example above.


   <B>Fetching</B> <B>Compiled</B> <B>Descriptions</B>
       If the environment variable TERMINFO is set, it is  inter-
       preted  as the pathname of a directory containing the com-
       piled description you are working on.  Only that directory
       is searched.

       If  TERMINFO  is  not set, the <B>ncurses</B> version of the ter-
       minfo reader code  will  instead  look  in  the  directory
       <B>$HOME/.terminfo</B>  for  a compiled description.  If it fails
       to find one  there,  and  the  environment  variable  TER-
       MINFO_DIRS  is set, it will interpret the contents of that
       variable as a list of colon- separated directories  to  be
       searched  (an  empty  entry is interpreted as a command to
       search <I>/usr/share/terminfo</I>).  If no description  is  found
       in  any of the TERMINFO_DIRS directories, the fetch fails.

       If neither TERMINFO nor TERMINFO_DIRS  is  set,  the  last
       place   tried  will  be  the  system  terminfo  directory,
       <I>/usr/share/terminfo</I>.

       (Neither the  <B>$HOME/.terminfo</B>  lookups  nor  TERMINFO_DIRS
       extensions   are  supported  under  stock  System  V  ter-
       minfo/curses.)


   <B>Preparing</B> <B>Descriptions</B>
       We now outline how to prepare descriptions  of  terminals.
       The  most  effective way to prepare a terminal description
       is by imitating the description of a similar  terminal  in
       <I>terminfo</I>  and  to  build up a description gradually, using
       partial descriptions with <I>vi</I> or some other screen-oriented
       program  to  check that they are correct.  Be aware that a
       very unusual terminal may expose deficiencies in the abil-
       ity  of  the  <I>terminfo</I>  file to describe it or bugs in the
       screen-handling code of the test program.

       To get the padding for insert line right (if the  terminal
       manufacturer did not document it) a severe test is to edit
       a large file at 9600 baud, delete 16 or so lines from  the
       middle  of  the screen, then hit the `u' key several times
       quickly.  If the terminal messes up, more padding is  usu-
       ally  needed.  A similar test can be used for insert char-
       acter.


   <B>Basic</B> <B>Capabilities</B>
       The number of columns on each line  for  the  terminal  is
       given  by the <B>cols</B> numeric capability.  If the terminal is
       a CRT, then the number of lines on the screen is given  by
       the <B>lines</B> capability.  If the terminal wraps around to the
       beginning of the next  line  when  it  reaches  the  right
       margin,  then  it  should  have the <B>am</B> capability.  If the
       terminal can clear its screen, leaving the cursor  in  the
       home  position,  then  this  is  given by the <B>clear</B> string
       capability.  If  the  terminal  overstrikes  (rather  than
       clearing  a position when a character is struck over) then
       it should have the <B>os</B> capability.  If the  terminal  is  a
       printing terminal, with no soft copy unit, give it both <B>hc</B>
       and <B>os</B>.  (<B>os</B> applies to storage scope terminals,  such  as
       TEKTRONIX 4010 series, as well as hard copy and APL termi-
       nals.)  If there is a code to move the cursor to the  left
       edge  of the current row, give this as <B>cr</B>.  (Normally this
       will be carriage return, control M.)  If there is  a  code
       to  produce  an audible signal (bell, beep, etc) give this
       as <B>bel</B>.

       If there is a code to move the cursor one position to  the
       left  (such  as backspace) that capability should be given
       as <B>cub1</B>.  Similarly, codes to move to the right,  up,  and
       down should be given as <B>cuf1</B>, <B>cuu1</B>, and <B>cud1</B>.  These local
       cursor motions should not alter the text they  pass  over,
       for  example,  you would not normally use `<B>cuf1</B>= ' because
       the space would erase the character moved over.

       A very important point  here  is  that  the  local  cursor
       motions  encoded in <I>terminfo</I> are undefined at the left and
       top edges  of  a  CRT  terminal.   Programs  should  never
       attempt  to  backspace  around the left edge, unless <B>bw</B> is
       given, and never attempt to go up locally off the top.  In
       order  to  scroll text up, a program will go to the bottom
       left corner of the screen and send the <B>ind</B> (index) string.

       To scroll text down, a program goes to the top left corner
       of the screen and sends the  <B>ri</B>  (reverse  index)  string.
       The  strings  <B>ind</B>  and  <B>ri</B> are undefined when not on their
       respective corners of the screen.

       Parameterized versions of the scrolling sequences are <B>indn</B>
       and <B>rin</B> which have the same semantics as <B>ind</B> and <B>ri</B> except
       that they take one parameter, and scroll that many  lines.
       They  are also undefined except at the appropriate edge of
       the screen.

       The <B>am</B> capability tells whether the cursor sticks  at  the
       right  edge  of  the  screen when text is output, but this
       does not necessarily apply to a <B>cuf1</B> from the last column.
       The  only local motion which is defined from the left edge
       is if <B>bw</B> is given, then a <B>cub1</B> from  the  left  edge  will
       move  to the right edge of the previous row.  If <B>bw</B> is not
       given, the effect is undefined.  This is useful for  draw-
       ing  a box around the edge of the screen, for example.  If
       the terminal has switch selectable automatic margins,  the
       <I>terminfo</I>  file  usually assumes that this is on; i.e., <B>am</B>.
       If the terminal has a command which  moves  to  the  first
       column  of the next line, that command can be given as <B>nel</B>
       (newline).  It does not matter if the command  clears  the
       remainder  of  the current line, so if the terminal has no
       <B>cr</B> and <B>lf</B> it may still be possible to craft a working  <B>nel</B>
       out of one or both of them.

       These  capabilities  suffice  to  describe  hard-copy  and
       "glass-tty" terminals.  Thus  the  model  33  teletype  is
       described as

     33|tty33|tty|model 33 teletype,
     bel=^G, cols#72, cr=^M, cud1=^J, hc, ind=^J, os,

       while the Lear Siegler ADM-3 is described as

     adm3|3|lsi adm3,
     am, bel=^G, clear=^Z, cols#80, cr=^M, cub1=^H, cud1=^J,
     ind=^J, lines#24,


   <B>Parameterized</B> <B>Strings</B>
       Cursor  addressing  and other strings requiring parameters
       in the terminal are described by  a  parameterized  string
       capability,  with  <B><A HREF="printf.3S.html">printf(3S)</A></B>  like escapes <B>%x</B> in it.  For
       example, to address the  cursor,  the  <B>cup</B>  capability  is
       given, using two parameters: the row and column to address
       to.  (Rows and columns are numbered from zero and refer to
       the physical screen visible to the user, not to any unseen
       memory.)  If  the  terminal  has  memory  relative  cursor
       addressing, that can be indicated by <B>mrcup</B>.

       The  parameter  mechanism uses a stack and special <B>%</B> codes
       to manipulate it.  Typically a sequence will push  one  of
       the  parameters  onto  the stack and then print it in some
       format.  Often more complex operations are necessary.

       The <B>%</B> encodings have the following meanings:

            %%        outputs `%'
            %<I>[[</I>:<I>]flags][width[.precision]][</I>doxXs<I>]</I>
                      as in <B>printf</B>, flags are [-+#] and space
            %c        print pop() like %c in printf()
            %s        print pop() like %s in printf()

            %p[1-9]   push <I>i</I>'th parm
            %P[a-z]   set dynamic variable [a-z] to pop()
            %g[a-z]   get dynamic variable [a-z] and push it
            %P[A-Z]   set static variable [a-z] to pop()
            %g[A-Z]   get static variable [a-z] and push it
            %'<I>c</I>'      char constant <I>c</I>
            %{<I>nn</I>}     integer constant <I>nn</I>
            %l        push strlen(pop)

            %+ %- %* %/ %m
                      arithmetic (%m is mod): push(pop() op pop())

            %&amp; %| %^  bit operations: push(pop() op pop())
            %= %&gt; %&lt;  logical operations: push(pop() op pop())
            %A, %O    logical and &amp; or operations (for conditionals)
            %! %~     unary operations push(op pop())
            %i        add 1 to first two parameters (for ANSI terminals)

            %? expr %t thenpart %e elsepart %;
                      if-then-else, %e elsepart is optional.
                      else-if's are possible a la Algol 68:
                      %? c1 %t b1 %e c2 %t b2 %e c3 %t b3 %e c4 %t b4 %e %;
                      ci are conditions, bi are bodies.

       Binary operations are in postfix form with the operands in
       the  usual  order.   That  is,  to  get  x-5 one would use
       "%gx%{5}%-".  %P and %g variables  are  persistent  across
       escape-string evaluations.

       Consider the HP2645, which, to get to row 3 and column 12,
       needs to be sent \E&amp;a12c03Y  padded  for  6  milliseconds.
       Note  that  the  order of the rows and columns is inverted
       here, and that the row and column are printed as two  dig-
       its.  Thus its <B>cup</B> capability is "cup=6\E&amp;%p2%2dc%p1%2dY".

       The Microterm ACT-IV needs the current row and column sent
       preceded  by  a <B>^T</B>, with the row and column simply encoded
       in binary, "cup=^T%p1%c%p2%c".  Terminals which  use  "%c"
       need  to  be  able  to backspace the cursor (<B>cub1</B>), and to
       move the cursor up one line on the screen (<B>cuu1</B>).  This is
       necessary  because it is not always safe to transmit <B>\n</B> <B>^D</B>
       and <B>\r</B>, as the system may change or  discard  them.   (The
       library  routines  dealing  with terminfo set tty modes so
       that tabs are never expanded, so \t is safe to send.  This
       turns out to be essential for the Ann Arbor 4080.)

       A final example is the LSI ADM-3a, which uses row and col-
       umn  offset  by  a  blank  character,  thus  "cup=\E=%p1%'
       '%+%c%p2%'  '%+%c".   After sending `\E=', this pushes the
       first parameter, pushes the ASCII value for a space  (32),
       adds  them  (pushing  the sum on the stack in place of the
       two previous values) and outputs that value as  a  charac-
       ter.   Then  the  same  is  done for the second parameter.
       More complex arithmetic is possible using the stack.


   <B>Cursor</B> <B>Motions</B>
       If the terminal has a fast way to home the cursor (to very
       upper  left  corner  of  screen) then this can be given as
       <B>home</B>; similarly a fast way of getting to the  lower  left-
       hand  corner can be given as <B>ll</B>; this may involve going up
       with <B>cuu1</B> from the home position,  but  a  program  should
       never  do this itself (unless <B>ll</B> does) because it can make
       no assumption about the effect of moving up from the  home
       position.   Note  that  the  home  position is the same as
       addressing to (0,0): to the top left corner of the screen,
       not  of  memory.   (Thus, the \EH sequence on HP terminals
       cannot be used for <B>home</B>.)

       If the terminal has row or column absolute cursor address-
       ing,  these  can be given as single parameter capabilities
       <B>hpa</B> (horizontal position absolute) and <B>vpa</B> (vertical posi-
       tion absolute).  Sometimes these are shorter than the more
       general two parameter sequence (as with  the  hp2645)  and
       can be used in preference to <B>cup</B>.  If there are parameter-
       ized local motions (e.g., move  <I>n</I>  spaces  to  the  right)
       these can be given as <B>cud</B>, <B>cub</B>, <B>cuf</B>, and <B>cuu</B> with a single
       parameter indicating how many spaces to move.   These  are
       primarily  useful  if the terminal does not have <B>cup</B>, such
       as the TEKTRONIX 4025.

       If the terminal needs to be in a special mode when running
       a program that uses these capabilities, the codes to enter
       and exit this mode can be given as <B>smcup</B> and <B>rmcup</B>.   This
       arises,  for example, from terminals like the Concept with
       more than one page of memory.  If the  terminal  has  only
       memory  relative cursor addressing and not screen relative
       cursor addressing, a one screen-sized window must be fixed
       into  the terminal for cursor addressing to work properly.
       This is also used for the TEKTRONIX 4025, where <B>smcup</B> sets
       the  command character to be the one used by terminfo.  If
       the <B>smcup</B> sequence will not restore the  screen  after  an
       <B>rmcup</B> sequence is output (to the state prior to outputting
       <B>rmcup</B>), specify <B>nrrmc</B>.


   <B>Area</B> <B>Clears</B>
       If the terminal can clear from the current position to the
       end  of  the  line,  leaving  the cursor where it is, this
       should be given as <B>el</B>.  If the terminal can clear from the
       beginning  of  the line to the current position inclusive,
       leaving the cursor where it is, this should  be  given  as
       <B>el1</B>.   If the terminal can clear from the current position
       to the end of the display, then this should  be  given  as
       <B>ed</B>.   <B>Ed</B>  is only defined from the first column of a line.
       (Thus, it can be simulated by a request to delete a  large
       number of lines, if a true <B>ed</B> is not available.)


   <B>Insert/delete</B> <B>line</B> <B>and</B> <B>vertical</B> <B>motions</B>
       If  the terminal can open a new blank line before the line
       where the cursor is, this should be given as <B>il1</B>; this  is
       done  only  from the first position of a line.  The cursor
       must then appear on the newly blank line.  If the terminal
       can  delete  the  line  which  the cursor is on, then this
       should be given as <B>dl1</B>; this is done only from  the  first
       position  on  the line to be deleted.  Versions of <B>il1</B> and
       <B>dl1</B> which take a single parameter  and  insert  or  delete
       that many lines can be given as <B>il</B> and <B>dl</B>.

       If  the terminal has a settable scrolling region (like the
       vt100) the command to set this can be described  with  the
       <B>csr</B>  capability,  which  takes two parameters: the top and
       bottom lines of the scrolling region.  The cursor position
       is, alas, undefined after using this command.

       It  is possible to get the effect of insert or delete line
       using <B>csr</B> on a properly chosen region; the <B>sc</B> and <B>rc</B> (save
       and  restore  cursor)  commands may be useful for ensuring
       that your synthesized insert/delete string does  not  move
       the  cursor.  (Note that the <B><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></B> library does this
       synthesis  automatically,  so   you   need   not   compose
       insert/delete strings for an entry with <B>csr</B>).

       Yet another way to construct insert and delete might be to
       use a combination of index with  the  memory-lock  feature
       found  on some terminals (like the HP-700/90 series, which
       however also has insert/delete).

       Inserting lines at the top or bottom  of  the  screen  can
       also  be  done using <B>ri</B> or <B>ind</B> on many terminals without a
       true insert/delete line, and is often faster even on  ter-
       minals with those features.

       The  boolean  <B>non_dest_scroll_region</B> should be set if each
       scrolling window is effectively a view port on  a  screen-
       sized  canvas.   To  test  for  this  capability, create a
       scrolling region in the middle of the screen, write  some-
       thing  to  the  bottom line, move the cursor to the top of
       the region, and do <B>ri</B> followed by <B>dl1</B> or <B>ind</B>.  If the data
       scrolled  off  the  bottom  of  the  region  by the <B>ri</B> re-
       appears, then scrolling is non-destructive.  System V  and
       XSI  Curses  expect that <B>ind</B>, <B>ri</B>, <B>indn</B>, and <B>rin</B> will simu-
       late destructive scrolling; their  documentation  cautions
       you  not  to  define <B>csr</B> unless this is true.  This <B>curses</B>
       implementation is more liberal and will do explicit erases
       after scrolling if <B>ndstr</B> is defined.

       If the terminal has the ability to define a window as part
       of memory, which all commands affect, it should  be  given
       as the parameterized string <B>wind</B>.  The four parameters are
       the starting and ending lines in memory and  the  starting
       and ending columns in memory, in that order.

       If  the terminal can retain display memory above, then the
       <B>da</B> capability should be given; if display  memory  can  be
       retained  below,  then <B>db</B> should be given.  These indicate
       that deleting a line  or  scrolling  may  bring  non-blank
       lines  up  from  below  or that scrolling back with <B>ri</B> may
       bring down non-blank lines.


   <B>Insert/Delete</B> <B>Character</B>
       There are two basic kinds of  intelligent  terminals  with
       respect  to insert/delete character which can be described
       using <I>terminfo.</I>  The most common  insert/delete  character
       operations  affect only the characters on the current line
       and shift characters off the  end  of  the  line  rigidly.
       Other  terminals,  such  as the Concept 100 and the Perkin
       Elmer Owl, make a distinction between  typed  and  untyped
       blanks  on  the  screen, shifting upon an insert or delete
       only to an untyped blank on the  screen  which  is  either
       eliminated,  or  expanded  to two untyped blanks.  You can
       determine the kind of terminal you have  by  clearing  the
       screen  and  then typing text separated by cursor motions.
       Type "abc    def" using local cursor motions (not  spaces)
       between the "abc" and the "def".  Then position the cursor
       before the "abc" and put the terminal in insert mode.   If
       typing  characters  causes  the  rest of the line to shift
       rigidly and characters to fall off the end, then your ter-
       minal  does  not  distinguish  between  blanks and untyped
       positions.  If the "abc" shifts over to  the  "def"  which
       then  move together around the end of the current line and
       onto the next as you insert, you have the second  type  of
       terminal,  and should give the capability <B>in</B>, which stands
       for "insert null".  While these are two logically separate
       attributes  (one line vs. multi-line insert mode, and spe-
       cial treatment of untyped spaces) we have seen  no  termi-
       nals whose insert mode cannot be described with the single
       attribute.

       Terminfo can describe both terminals which have an  insert
       mode, and terminals which send a simple sequence to open a
       blank position on the current  line.   Give  as  <B>smir</B>  the
       sequence  to  get  into  insert  mode.   Give  as <B>rmir</B> the
       sequence to leave insert  mode.   Now  give  as  <B>ich1</B>  any
       sequence needed to be sent just before sending the charac-
       ter to be inserted.  Most terminals  with  a  true  insert
       mode  will  not give <B>ich1</B>; terminals which send a sequence
       to open a screen position should give it here.

       If your terminal has both, insert mode is usually  prefer-
       able  to  <B>ich1</B>.   Technically,  you  should  not give both
       unless the terminal actually requires both to be  used  in
       combination.   Accordingly,  some  non-curses applications
       get confused if both are present; the symptom  is  doubled
       characters in an update using insert.  This requirement is
       now rare; most <B>ich</B> sequences do not require previous smir,
       and most smir insert modes do not require <B>ich1</B> before each
       character.  Therefore, the  new  <B>curses</B>  actually  assumes
       this  is the case and uses either <B>rmir</B>/<B>smir</B> or <B>ich</B>/<B>ich1</B> as
       appropriate (but not both).  If you have to write an entry
       to  be  used under new curses for a terminal old enough to
       need both, include the <B>rmir</B>/<B>smir</B> sequences in <B>ich1</B>.

       If post insert padding is needed, give this as a number of
       milliseconds  in <B>ip</B> (a string option).  Any other sequence
       which may need to be sent after  an  insert  of  a  single
       character may also be given in <B>ip</B>.  If your terminal needs
       both to be placed into an `insert mode' and a special code
       to  precede  each  inserted character, then both <B>smir</B>/<B>rmir</B>
       and <B>ich1</B> can be given, and both will  be  used.   The  <B>ich</B>
       capability, with one parameter, <I>n</I>, will repeat the effects
       of <B>ich1</B> <I>n</I> times.

       If padding is necessary between characters typed while not
       in  insert  mode,  give  this  as a number of milliseconds
       padding in <B>rmp</B>.

       It is occasionally  necessary  to  move  around  while  in
       insert  mode  to delete characters on the same line (e.g.,
       if there is a tab after the insertion position).  If  your
       terminal  allows  motion while in insert mode you can give
       the capability <B>mir</B> to speed up  inserting  in  this  case.
       Omitting  <B>mir</B>  will  affect  only  speed.   Some terminals
       (notably Datamedia's) must not have <B>mir</B> because of the way
       their insert mode works.

       Finally,  you  can specify <B>dch1</B> to delete a single charac-
       ter, <B>dch</B> with one parameter, <I>n</I>, to  delete  <I>n</I>  <I>characters,</I>
       and  delete mode by giving <B>smdc</B> and <B>rmdc</B> to enter and exit
       delete mode (any mode the terminal needs to be  placed  in
       for <B>dch1</B> to work).

       A  command to erase <I>n</I> characters (equivalent to outputting
       <I>n</I> blanks without moving the cursor) can be  given  as  <B>ech</B>
       with one parameter.


   <B>Highlighting,</B> <B>Underlining,</B> <B>and</B> <B>Visible</B> <B>Bells</B>
       If  your  terminal  has  one  or  more  kinds  of  display
       attributes, these can be represented in a number  of  dif-
       ferent ways.  You should choose one display form as <I>stand-</I>
       <I>out</I> <I>mode</I>, representing a good, high contrast, easy-on-the-
       eyes,  format  for  highlighting  error messages and other
       attention getters.  (If you have a choice,  reverse  video
       plus  half-bright  is  good, or reverse video alone.)  The
       sequences to enter and exit standout  mode  are  given  as
       <B>smso</B>  and  <B>rmso</B>, respectively.  If the code to change into
       or out of standout mode  leaves  one  or  even  two  blank
       spaces  on the screen, as the TVI 912 and Teleray 1061 do,
       then <B>xmc</B> should be given to tell how many spaces are left.

       Codes  to  begin  underlining  and  end underlining can be
       given as <B>smul</B> and <B>rmul</B> respectively.  If the terminal  has
       a  code  to  underline  the current character and move the
       cursor one space to the right, such as the Microterm Mime,
       this can be given as <B>uc</B>.

       Other  capabilities  to  enter  various highlighting modes
       include <B>blink</B> (blinking) <B>bold</B> (bold or extra  bright)  <B>dim</B>
       (dim  or  half-bright)  <B>invis</B> (blanking or invisible text)
       <B>prot</B> (protected) <B>rev</B> (reverse video) <B>sgr0</B>  (turn  off  <I>all</I>
       attribute  modes)  <B>smacs</B>  (enter  alternate  character set
       mode) and  <B>rmacs</B>  (exit  alternate  character  set  mode).
       Turning  on  any of these modes singly may or may not turn
       off other modes.

       If there is a sequence to set  arbitrary  combinations  of
       modes,  this should be given as <B>sgr</B> (set attributes), tak-
       ing 9 parameters.  Each parameter is either 0 or  nonzero,
       as the corresponding attribute is on or off.  The 9 param-
       eters are, in order: standout, underline, reverse,  blink,
       dim,  bold,  blank, protect, alternate character set.  Not
       all modes need be supported by <B>sgr</B>, only those  for  which
       corresponding separate attribute commands exist.

       For example, the DEC vt220 supports most of the modes:

           <B>tparm</B> <B>parameter</B>   <B>attribute</B>    <B>escape</B> <B>sequence</B>

           none              none         \E[0m
           p1                standout     \E[0;1;7m
           p2                underline    \E[0;4m
           p3                reverse      \E[0;7m
           p4                blink        \E[0;5m
           p5                dim          not available
           p6                bold         \E[0;1m
           p7                invis        \E[0;8m
           p8                protect      not used
           p9                altcharset   ^O (off) ^N (on)

       We  begin each escape sequence by turning off any existing
       modes, since there is no quick way  to  determine  whether
       they are active.  Standout is set up to be the combination
       of reverse and bold.  The vt220  terminal  has  a  protect
       mode,  though  it  is  not commonly used in sgr because it
       protects characters on the screen  from  the  host's  era-
       sures.   The  altcharset mode also is different in that it
       is either ^O or ^N, depending on whether it is off or  on.
       If  all  modes  are  turned  on, the resulting sequence is
       \E[0;1;4;5;7;8m^N.

       Some sequences are common to different modes.   For  exam-
       ple,  ;7  is output when either p1 or p3 is true, that is,
       if either standout or reverse modes are turned on.

       Writing out the above sequences, along with  their  depen-
       dencies yields

         <B>sequence</B>    <B>when</B> <B>to</B> <B>output</B>     <B>terminfo</B> <B>translation</B>

         \E[0       always              \E[0
         ;1         if p1 or p6         %?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;
         ;4         if p2               %?%p2%|%t;4%;

         ;5         if p4               %?%p4%|%t;5%;
         ;7         if p1 or p3         %?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;
         ;8         if p7               %?%p7%|%t;8%;
         m          always              m
         ^N or ^O   if p9 ^N, else ^O   %?%p9%t^N%e^O%;

       Putting this all together into the sgr sequence gives:

           sgr=\E[0%?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;%?%p2%t;4%;%?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;
               %?%p4%t;5%;%?%p7%t;8%;m%?%p9%t\016%e\017%;,

       Remember  that  if  you specify sgr, you must also specify
       sgr0.

       Terminals with the ``magic cookie'' glitch  (<B>xmc</B>)  deposit
       special   ``cookies''   when   they  receive  mode-setting
       sequences, which affect the display algorithm rather  than
       having  extra  bits  for  each character.  Some terminals,
       such as the HP 2621,  automatically  leave  standout  mode
       when  they  move to a new line or the cursor is addressed.
       Programs using standout mode  should  exit  standout  mode
       before  moving the cursor or sending a newline, unless the
       <B>msgr</B> capability, asserting that it  is  safe  to  move  in
       standout mode, is present.

       If  the terminal has a way of flashing the screen to indi-
       cate an error quietly (a bell replacement) then  this  can
       be given as <B>flash</B>; it must not move the cursor.

       If  the  cursor  needs to be made more visible than normal
       when it is not on the bottom line (to make, for example, a
       non-blinking  underline  into  an  easier to find block or
       blinking underline) give this sequence as <B>cvvis</B>.  If there
       is  a  way  to  make the cursor completely invisible, give
       that as <B>civis</B>.  The capability <B>cnorm</B> should be given which
       undoes the effects of both of these modes.

       If your terminal correctly generates underlined characters
       (with no special codes needed) even  though  it  does  not
       overstrike,  then you should give the capability <B>ul</B>.  If a
       character overstriking another leaves both  characters  on
       the screen, specify the capability <B>os</B>.  If overstrikes are
       erasable with a blank, then this should  be  indicated  by
       giving <B>eo</B>.


   <B>Keypad</B> <B>and</B> <B>Function</B> <B>Keys</B>
       If the terminal has a keypad that transmits codes when the
       keys are pressed, this information can be given. Note that
       it  is  not  possible to handle terminals where the keypad
       only works in local (this applies,  for  example,  to  the
       unshifted  HP  2621  keys).   If  the keypad can be set to
       transmit or not transmit, give these  codes  as  <B>smkx</B>  and
       <B>rmkx</B>.  Otherwise the keypad is assumed to always transmit.
       The codes sent by the left arrow, right arrow,  up  arrow,
       down  arrow,  and  home keys can be given as <B>kcub1,</B> <B>kcuf1,</B>
       <B>kcuu1,</B> <B>kcud1,</B> and <B>khome</B> respectively.  If there are  func-
       tion  keys  such  as f0, f1, ..., f10, the codes they send
       can be given as <B>kf0,</B> <B>kf1,</B> <B>...,</B> <B>kf10</B>.  If these  keys  have
       labels  other  than the default f0 through f10, the labels
       can be given as <B>lf0,</B> <B>lf1,</B> <B>...,</B> <B>lf10</B>.  The codes  transmit-
       ted  by certain other special keys can be given: <B>kll</B> (home
       down), <B>kbs</B>  (backspace),  <B>ktbc</B>  (clear  all  tabs),  <B>kctab</B>
       (clear the tab stop in this column), <B>kclr</B> (clear screen or
       erase key), <B>kdch1</B> (delete character), <B>kdl1</B> (delete  line),
       <B>krmir</B>  (exit insert mode), <B>kel</B> (clear to end of line), <B>ked</B>
       (clear to end of screen), <B>kich1</B> (insert character or enter
       insert  mode),  <B>kil1</B>  (insert  line), <B>knp</B> (next page), <B>kpp</B>
       (previous page), <B>kind</B> (scroll forward/down),  <B>kri</B>  (scroll
       backward/up),  <B>khts</B>  (set  a tab stop in this column).  In
       addition, if the keypad has a 3 by 3 array of keys includ-
       ing  the four arrow keys, the other five keys can be given
       as <B>ka1</B>, <B>ka3</B>, <B>kb2</B>, <B>kc1</B>, and <B>kc3</B>.   These  keys  are  useful
       when the effects of a 3 by 3 directional pad are needed.

       Strings  to  program  function keys can be given as <B>pfkey</B>,
       <B>pfloc</B>, and <B>pfx</B>.  A string to program screen labels  should
       be  specified  as  <B>pln</B>.   Each  of these strings takes two
       parameters: the function key number to program (from 0  to
       10)  and the string to program it with.  Function key num-
       bers out of this range may program  undefined  keys  in  a
       terminal  dependent  manner.   The  difference between the
       capabilities is that <B>pfkey</B> causes pressing the  given  key
       to  be the same as the user typing the given string; <B>pfloc</B>
       causes the string to be executed by the terminal in local;
       and  <B>pfx</B>  causes  the string to be transmitted to the com-
       puter.

       The capabilities <B>nlab</B>, <B>lw</B> and <B>lh</B> define the number of pro-
       grammable  screen  labels  and their width and height.  If
       there are commands to turn the labels  on  and  off,  give
       them  in <B>smln</B> and <B>rmln</B>.  <B>smln</B> is normally output after one
       or more pln sequences to make sure that the change becomes
       visible.


   <B>Tabs</B> <B>and</B> <B>Initialization</B>
       If  the terminal has hardware tabs, the command to advance
       to the next tab stop can be given as <B>ht</B>  (usually  control
       I).   A  ``back-tab''  command which moves leftward to the
       preceding tab stop can be given as <B>cbt</B>.  By convention, if
       the  teletype  modes indicate that tabs are being expanded
       by the computer rather than being sent  to  the  terminal,
       programs  should  not  use <B>ht</B> or <B>cbt</B> even if they are pre-
       sent, since the user may not have the tab  stops  properly
       set.   If  the  terminal  has hardware tabs which are ini-
       tially set every <I>n</I> spaces when the terminal is powered up,
       the  numeric  parameter <B>it</B> is given, showing the number of
       spaces the tabs are set to.  This is normally used by  the
       <I>tset</I>  command  to  determine  whether  to set the mode for
       hardware tab expansion, and whether to set the tab  stops.
       If  the  terminal  has tab stops that can be saved in non-
       volatile memory, the terminfo description can assume  that
       they are properly set.

       Other  capabilities include <B>is1</B>, <B>is2</B>, and <B>is3</B>, initializa-
       tion strings for the terminal, <B>iprog</B>, the path name  of  a
       program  to be run to initialize the terminal, and <B>if</B>, the
       name of a file  containing  long  initialization  strings.
       These  strings are expected to set the terminal into modes
       consistent with the  rest  of  the  terminfo  description.
       They are normally sent to the terminal, by the <I>init</I> option
       of the <I>tput</I> program, each time the  user  logs  in.   They
       will  be  printed  in the following order: run the program
       <B>iprog</B>; output <B>is1</B>; <B>is2</B>; set the margins  using  <B>mgc</B>,  <B>smgl</B>
       and  <B>smgr</B>;  set tabs using <B>tbc</B> and <B>hts</B>; print the file <B>if</B>;
       and finally output <B>is3</B>.

       Most initialization is done with  <B>is2</B>.   Special  terminal
       modes can be set up without duplicating strings by putting
       the common sequences in <B>is2</B> and special cases in  <B>is1</B>  and
       <B>is3</B>.   A pair of sequences that does a harder reset from a
       totally unknown state can be  analogously  given  as  <B>rs1</B>,
       <B>rs2</B>,  <B>rf</B>, and <B>rs3</B>, analogous to <B>is2</B> and <B>if</B>.  These strings
       are output by the <I>reset</I> program, which is  used  when  the
       terminal  gets into a wedged state.  Commands are normally
       placed in <B>rs1</B>, <B>rs2</B> <B>rs3</B> and <B>rf</B> only if they produce  annoy-
       ing  effects on the screen and are not necessary when log-
       ging in.  For example, the command to set the  vt100  into
       80-column  mode  would  normally  be  part  of <B>is2</B>, but it
       causes an annoying glitch of the screen and  is  not  nor-
       mally  needed  since the terminal is usually already in 80
       column mode.

       If there are commands to set and clear tab stops, they can
       be  given  as <B>tbc</B> (clear all tab stops) and <B>hts</B> (set a tab
       stop in the current column of every row).  If a more  com-
       plex  sequence  is  needed  to  set  the  tabs than can be
       described by this, the sequence can be placed  in  <B>is2</B>  or
       <B>if</B>.

   <B>Delays</B> <B>and</B> <B>Padding</B>
       Many  older  and  slower  terminals  don't  support either
       XON/XOFF or DTR handshaking, including hard copy terminals
       and  some  very  archaic CRTs (including, for example, DEC
       VT100s).  These may require padding characters after  cer-
       tain cursor motions and screen changes.

       If the terminal uses xon/xoff handshaking for flow control
       (that is, it automatically emits ^S back to the host  when
       its input buffers are close to full), set <B>xon</B>.  This capa-
       bility suppresses the emission of padding.  You  can  also
       set  it for memory-mapped console devices effectively that
       don't have a  speed  limit.   Padding  information  should
       still  be  included so that routines can make better deci-
       sions about relative costs, but actual pad characters will
       not be transmitted.

       If  <B>pb</B> (padding baud rate) is given, padding is suppressed
       at baud rates below the value of <B>pb</B>.  If the entry has  no
       padding  baud rate, then whether padding is emitted or not
       is completely controlled by <B>xon</B>.

       If the terminal requires other than a null (zero)  charac-
       ter  as  a  pad,  then this can be given as <B>pad</B>.  Only the
       first character of the <B>pad</B> string is used.


   <B>Status</B> <B>Lines</B>
       Some terminals have an extra `status line'  which  is  not
       normally  used  by  software  (and thus not counted in the
       terminal's <B>lines</B> capability).

       The simplest case  is  a  status  line  which  is  cursor-
       addressable  but  not part of the main scrolling region on
       the screen; the Heathkit H19 has a  status  line  of  this
       kind,  as  would  a 24-line VT100 with a 23-line scrolling
       region set up on initialization.  This situation is  indi-
       cated by the <B>hs</B> capability.

       Some terminals with status lines need special sequences to
       access the status line.   These  may  be  expressed  as  a
       string with single parameter <B>tsl</B> which takes the cursor to
       a given zero-origin column on the status line.  The  capa-
       bility <B>fsl</B> must return to the main-screen cursor positions
       before the last <B>tsl</B>.  You may need  to  embed  the  string
       values  of <B>sc</B> (save cursor) and <B>rc</B> (restore cursor) in <B>tsl</B>
       and <B>fsl</B> to accomplish this.

       The status line is normally assumed to be the  same  width
       as  the width of the terminal.  If this is untrue, you can
       specify it with the numeric capability <B>wsl</B>.

       A command to erase or blank the status line may be  speci-
       fied as <B>dsl</B>.

       The   boolean   capability  <B>eslok</B>  specifies  that  escape
       sequences, tabs, etc. work ordinarily in the status  line.

       The  <B>ncurses</B>  implementation does not yet use any of these
       capabilities.  They are documented here in case they  ever
       become important.


   <B>Line</B> <B>Graphics</B>
       Many  terminals  have  alternate character sets useful for
       forms-drawing.  Terminfo and <B>curses</B> build in  support  for
       the  drawing  characters supported by the VT100, with some
       characters from the AT&amp;T  4410v1  added.   This  alternate
       character set may be specified by the <B>acsc</B> capability.

                <B>Glyph</B>             <B>ACS</B>            <B>Ascii</B>      <B>VT100</B>

       The  best  way to define a new device's graphics set is to
       add a column to a copy of this table  for  your  terminal,
       giving   the   character   which   (when  emitted  between
       <B>smacs</B>/<B>rmacs</B> switches) will be rendered as the  correspond-
       ing  graphic.  Then read off the VT100/your terminal char-
       acter pairs right to left in sequence;  these  become  the
       ACSC string.


   <B>Color</B> <B>Handling</B>
       Most  color  terminals are either `Tektronix-like' or `HP-
       like'.  Tektronix-like terminals have a predefined set  of
       N  colors  (where N usually 8), and can set character-cell
       foreground and background characters independently, mixing
       them  into  N  * N color-pairs.  On HP-like terminals, the
       use must set each color pair up separately (foreground and
       background  are  not  independently  settable).   Up  to M
       color-pairs may be  set  up  from  2*M  different  colors.
       ANSI-compatible terminals are Tektronix-like.

       Some basic color capabilities are independent of the color
       method.  The numeric capabilities <B>colors</B> and <B>pairs</B> specify
       the  maximum numbers of colors and color-pairs that can be
       displayed simultaneously.  The <B>op</B> (original  pair)  string
       resets  foreground  and background colors to their default
       values for the terminal.  The <B>oc</B> string resets all  colors
       or  color-pairs  to their default values for the terminal.
       Some terminals  (including  many  PC  terminal  emulators)
       erase  screen  areas  with  the  current  background color
       rather than the power-up default background; these  should
       have the boolean capability <B>bce</B>.

       To  change the current foreground or background color on a
       Tektronix-type terminal, use <B>setaf</B> (set  ANSI  foreground)
       and  <B>setab</B>  (set ANSI background) or <B>setf</B> (set foreground)
       and <B>setb</B> (set background).  These take one parameter,  the
       color  number.   The  SVr4  documentation  describes  only
       <B>setaf</B>/<B>setab</B>; the XPG4 draft says  that  "If  the  terminal
       supports ANSI escape sequences to set background and fore-
       ground, they should be coded as <B>setaf</B> and  <B>setab</B>,  respec-
       tively.   If  the terminal supports other escape sequences
       to set background and foreground, they should be coded  as
       <B>setf</B>  and  <B>setb</B>, respectively.  The <I>vidputs()</I> function and
       the refresh functions use <B>setaf</B>  and  <B>setab</B>  if  they  are
       defined."

       The  <B>setaf</B>/<B>setab</B>  and <B>setf</B>/<B>setb</B> capabilities take a single
       numeric argument each.  Argument values 0-7  are  portably
       defined  as  follows  (the  middle  column is the symbolic
       #define available in the header for the <B>curses</B> or  <B>ncurses</B>
       libraries).  The terminal hardware is free to map these as
       it likes, but the RGB values indicate normal locations  in
       color space.

             <B>Color</B>       <B>#define</B>       <B>Value</B>       <B>RGB</B>
             black     <B>COLOR_BLACK</B>       0     0, 0, 0
             red       <B>COLOR_RED</B>         1     max,0,0
             green     <B>COLOR_GREEN</B>       2     0,max,0
             yellow    <B>COLOR_YELLOW</B>      3     max,max,0
             blue      <B>COLOR_BLUE</B>        4     0,0,max
             magenta   <B>COLOR_MAGENTA</B>     5     max,0,max
             cyan      <B>COLOR_CYAN</B>        6     0,max,max
             white     <B>COLOR_WHITE</B>       7     max,max,max

       On  an  HP-like terminal, use <B>scp</B> with a color-pair number
       parameter to set which color pair is current.

       On a Tektronix-like terminal, the capability  <B>ccc</B>  may  be
       present  to  indicate that colors can be modified.  If so,
       the <B>initc</B> capability will take a color number (0 to <B>colors</B>
       -  1)and  three  more parameters which describe the color.
       These three parameters default to being interpreted as RGB
       (Red,  Green, Blue) values.  If the boolean capability <B>hls</B>
       is present, they are instead as HLS (Hue, Lightness, Satu-
       ration) indices.  The ranges are terminal-dependent.

       On  an  HP-like  terminal, <B>initp</B> may give a capability for
       changing a color-pair value.  It will take  seven  parame-
       ters;  a  color-pair  number (0 to <B>max_pairs</B> - 1), and two
       triples describing first background  and  then  foreground
       colors.   These  parameters  must be (Red, Green, Blue) or
       (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) depending on <B>hls</B>.

       On some color terminals, colors collide  with  highlights.
       You can register these collisions with the <B>ncv</B> capability.
       This is a bit-mask of attributes not to be used when  col-
       ors  are  enabled.  The correspondence with the attributes
       understood by <B>curses</B> is as follows:

                      <B>Attribute</B>      <B>Bit</B>   <B>Decimal</B>
                      A_STANDOUT     0     1
                      A_UNDERLINE    1     2
                      A_REVERSE      2     4
                      A_BLINK        3     8
                      A_DIM          4     16
                      A_BOLD         5     32
                      A_INVIS        6     64
                      A_PROTECT      7     128
                      A_ALTCHARSET   8     256

       For example,  on  many  IBM  PC  consoles,  the  underline
       attribute  collides  with the foreground color blue and is
       not available in color mode.  These  should  have  an  <B>ncv</B>
       capability of 2.

       SVr4  curses  does nothing with <B>ncv</B>, ncurses recognizes it
       and optimizes the output in favor of colors.


   <B>Miscellaneous</B>
       If the terminal requires other than a null (zero)  charac-
       ter  as  a  pad,  then this can be given as pad.  Only the
       first character of the pad string is used.  If the  termi-
       nal does not have a pad character, specify npc.  Note that
       ncurses implements  the  termcap-compatible  <B>PC</B>  variable;
       though  the  application  may  set this value to something
       other than a null, ncurses will test  <B>npc</B>  first  and  use
       napms if the terminal has no pad character.

       If  the terminal can move up or down half a line, this can
       be indicated with <B>hu</B>  (half-line  up)  and  <B>hd</B>  (half-line
       down).   This  is  primarily  useful  for superscripts and
       subscripts on hard-copy terminals.  If a hard-copy  termi-
       nal  can  eject to the next page (form feed), give this as
       <B>ff</B> (usually control L).

       If there is a command to repeat a given character a  given
       number  of times (to save time transmitting a large number
       of identical characters) this can be  indicated  with  the
       parameterized  string  <B>rep</B>.   The  first  parameter is the
       character to be repeated and the second is the  number  of
       times  to repeat it.  Thus, tparm(repeat_char, 'x', 10) is
       the same as `xxxxxxxxxx'.

       If the terminal has a settable command character, such  as
       the  TEKTRONIX  4025, this can be indicated with <B>cmdch</B>.  A
       prototype command character is chosen which is used in all
       capabilities.   This character is given in the <B>cmdch</B> capa-
       bility to identify it.  The following convention  is  sup-
       ported  on  some  UNIX  systems:  The environment is to be
       searched for a <B>CC</B> variable, and if found, all  occurrences
       of the prototype character are replaced with the character
       in the environment variable.

       Terminal descriptions that do  not  represent  a  specific
       kind of known terminal, such as <I>switch</I>, <I>dialup</I>, <I>patch</I>, and
       <I>network</I>, should include the  <B>gn</B>  (generic)  capability  so
       that  programs  can  complain that they do not know how to
       talk to the terminal.  (This capability does not apply  to
       <I>virtual</I>   terminal   descriptions  for  which  the  escape
       sequences are known.)

       If the terminal has a ``meta key'' which acts as  a  shift
       key,  setting  the  8th  bit of any character transmitted,
       this fact can be indicated with <B>km</B>.   Otherwise,  software
       will assume that the 8th bit is parity and it will usually
       be cleared.  If strings exist to turn this  ``meta  mode''
       on and off, they can be given as <B>smm</B> and <B>rmm</B>.

       If  the terminal has more lines of memory than will fit on
       the screen at once, the number of lines of memory  can  be
       indicated  with  <B>lm</B>.   A  value of <B>lm</B>#0 indicates that the
       number of lines is not fixed, but that there is still more
       memory than fits on the screen.

       If the terminal is one of those supported by the UNIX vir-
       tual terminal protocol, the terminal number can  be  given
       as <B>vt</B>.

       Media copy strings which control an auxiliary printer con-
       nected to the terminal can be given as <B>mc0</B>: print the con-
       tents  of  the screen, <B>mc4</B>: turn off the printer, and <B>mc5</B>:
       turn on the printer.  When the printer  is  on,  all  text
       sent  to  the terminal will be sent to the printer.  It is
       undefined whether the text is also displayed on the termi-
       nal screen when the printer is on.  A variation <B>mc5p</B> takes
       one parameter, and leaves the printer on for as many char-
       acters  as  the  value  of  the  parameter, then turns the
       printer off.  The parameter should not  exceed  255.   All
       text,  including  <B>mc4</B>,  is  transparently  passed  to  the
       printer while an <B>mc5p</B> is in effect.


   <B>Glitches</B> <B>and</B> <B>Braindamage</B>
       Hazeltine terminals, which do not allow `~' characters  to
       be displayed should indicate <B>hz</B>.

       Terminals which ignore a line-feed immediately after an <B>am</B>
       wrap, such as the Concept and vt100, should indicate <B>xenl</B>.

       If  <B>el</B>  is  required  to  get  rid of standout (instead of
       merely writing normal text on top of it),  <B>xhp</B>  should  be
       given.

       Teleray  terminals,  where  tabs turn all characters moved
       over to blanks, should  indicate  <B>xt</B>  (destructive  tabs).
       Note:    the    variable    indicating    this    is   now
       `dest_tabs_magic_smso'; in older  versions,  it  was  tel-
       eray_glitch.  This glitch is also taken to mean that it is
       not possible to position the cursor on top  of  a  ``magic
       cookie'', that to erase standout mode it is instead neces-
       sary to use delete and insert line.  The ncurses implemen-
       tation ignores this glitch.

       The  Beehive Superbee, which is unable to correctly trans-
       mit the escape or control C characters, has <B>xsb</B>,  indicat-
       ing  that the f1 key is used for escape and f2 for control
       C.  (Only certain Superbees have this  problem,  depending
       on  the  ROM.)  Note that in older terminfo versions, this
       capability  was  called  `beehive_glitch';   it   is   now
       `no_esc_ctl_c'.

       Other  specific  terminal  problems  may  be  corrected by
       adding more capabilities of the form <B>x</B><I>x</I>.


   <B>Similar</B> <B>Terminals</B>
       If there are two very similar terminals, one (the variant)
       can  be  defined  as  being just like the other (the base)
       with certain exceptions.  In the definition of  the  vari-
       ant,  the string capability <B>use</B> can be given with the name
       of the base terminal.  The capabilities given  before  <B>use</B>
       override  those  in  the base type named by <B>use</B>.  If there
       are multiple <B>use</B> capabilities, they are merged in  reverse
       order.   That is, the rightmost <B>use</B> reference is processed
       first, then the one to its left, and so forth.   Capabili-
       ties  given explicitly in the entry override those brought
       in by <B>use</B> references.

       A capability can be canceled by placing <B>xx@</B> to the left of
       the  use  reference that imports it, where <I>xx</I> is the capa-
       bility.  For example, the entry

                   2621-nl, smkx@, rmkx@, use=2621,

       defines a 2621-nl that does not  have  the  <B>smkx</B>  or  <B>rmkx</B>
       capabilities,  and hence does not turn on the function key
       labels when in visual mode.  This is useful for  different
       modes for a terminal, or for different user preferences.


   <B>Pitfalls</B> <B>of</B> <B>Long</B> <B>Entries</B>
       Long  terminfo  entries  are  unlikely to be a problem; to
       date, no entry has even approached terminfo's  4K  string-
       table  maximum.   Unfortunately,  the termcap translations
       are much more  strictly  limited  (to  1K),  thus  termcap
       translations  of long terminfo entries can cause problems.

       The man pages for 4.3BSD and older versions  of  tgetent()
       instruct  the user to allocate a 1K buffer for the termcap
       entry.  The entry  gets  null-terminated  by  the  termcap
       library, so that makes the maximum safe length for a term-
       cap entry 1k-1 (1023) bytes.  Depending on what the appli-
       cation  and the termcap library being used does, and where
       in the termcap file the terminal type  that  tgetent()  is
       searching for is, several bad things can happen.

       Some  termcap libraries print a warning message or exit if
       they find an entry that's longer than 1023  bytes;  others
       don't;  others  truncate  the entries to 1023 bytes.  Some
       application programs allocate more than the recommended 1K
       for the termcap entry; others don't.

       Each termcap entry has two important sizes associated with
       it: before "tc" expansion, and after "tc" expansion.  "tc"
       is  the  capability that tacks on another termcap entry to
       the end of the current one, to add  on  its  capabilities.
       If  a  termcap entry doesn't use the "tc" capability, then
       of course the two lengths are the same.

       The "before tc expansion" length  is  the  most  important
       one,  because it affects more than just users of that par-
       ticular terminal.  This is the length of the entry  as  it
       exists in /etc/termcap, minus the backslash-newline pairs,
       which tgetent() strips out while reading it.  Some termcap
       libraries  strip  off  the final newline, too (GNU termcap
       does not).  Now suppose:

       *    a termcap entry before expansion is  more  than  1023
            bytes long,

       *    and the application has only allocated a 1k buffer,

       *    and  the  termcap library (like the one in BSD/OS 1.1
            and GNU) reads the whole entry into  the  buffer,  no
            matter  what  its length, to see if it's the entry it
            wants,

       *    and tgetent() is searching for a terminal  type  that
            either is the long entry, appears in the termcap file
            after the long entry, or doesn't appear in  the  file
            at  all  (so  that  tgetent() has to search the whole
            termcap file).

       Then tgetent() will overwrite memory, perhaps  its  stack,
       and  probably core dump the program.  Programs like telnet
       are particularly vulnerable;  modern  telnets  pass  along
       values  like the terminal type automatically.  The results
       are almost as undesirable with  a  termcap  library,  like
       SunOS  4.1.3  and Ultrix 4.4, that prints warning messages
       when it reads an overly long termcap entry.  If a  termcap
       library  truncates  long  entries,  like  OSF/1 3.0, it is
       immune to dying here but will return  incorrect  data  for
       the terminal.

       The "after tc expansion" length will have a similar effect
       to the above, but only for people who actually set TERM to
       that  terminal type, since tgetent() only does "tc" expan-
       sion once it's found the terminal type it was looking for,
       not while searching.

       In summary, a termcap entry that is longer than 1023 bytes
       can cause, on various combinations  of  termcap  libraries
       and  applications,  a  core  dump,  warnings, or incorrect
       operation.  If it's too long even before  "tc"  expansion,
       it will have this effect even for users of some other ter-
       minal types and users whose TERM variable does not have  a
       termcap entry.

       When in -C (translate to termcap) mode, the <B>ncurses</B> imple-
       mentation of <B><A HREF="tic.1.html">tic(1)</A></B> issues warning messages when the  pre-
       tc  length  of  a termcap translation is too long.  The -c
       (check) option also checks resolved (after  tc  expansion)
       lengths.

   <B>Binary</B> <B>Compatibility</B>
       It  is not wise to count on portability of binary terminfo
       entries between commercial UNIX versions.  The problem  is
       that  there  are  at least two versions of terminfo (under
       HP-UX and AIX) which diverged from System V terminfo after
       SVr1,  and have added extension capabilities to the string
       table that (in the binary format) collide  with  System  V
       and XSI Curses extensions.


</PRE>
<H2>EXTENSIONS</H2><PRE>
       Some  SVr4  <B>curses</B>  implementations,  and  all previous to
       SVr4, don't interpret the %A and %O operators in parameter
       strings.
       SVr4/XPG4  do  not  specify whether <B>msgr</B> licenses movement
       while in an alternate-character-set mode (such modes  may,
       among other things, map CR and NL to characters that don't
       trigger  local  motions).   The   <B>ncurses</B>   implementation
       ignores  <B>msgr</B>  in <B>ALTCHARSET</B> mode.  This raises the possi-
       bility that an XPG4  implementation  making  the  opposite
       interpretation  may need terminfo entries made for <B>ncurses</B>
       to have <B>msgr</B> turned off.

       The <B>ncurses</B> library handles insert-character  and  insert-
       character modes in a slightly non-standard way in order to
       get better update efficiency.  See the <B>Insert/Delete</B> <B>Char-</B>
       <B>acter</B> subsection above.

       The   parameter   substitutions  for  <B>set_clock</B>  and  <B>dis-</B>
       <B>play_clock</B> are not documented in SVr4 or  the  XSI  Curses
       standard.  They are deduced from the documentation for the
       AT&amp;T 505 terminal.

       Be careful assigning the <B>kmous</B>  capability.   The  <B>ncurses</B>
       wants  to  interpret it as <B>KEY_MOUSE</B>, for use by terminals
       and emulators like xterm that  can  return  mouse-tracking
       information in the keyboard-input stream.

       Different  commercial ports of terminfo and curses support
       different subsets of the XSI Curses standard and (in  some
       cases) different extension sets.  Here is a summary, accu-
       rate as of October 1995:

       <B>SVR4,</B> <B>Solaris,</B> <B>ncurses</B> -- These support all SVr4 capabili-
       ties.

       <B>SGI</B>  --  Supports  the  SVr4  set,  adds  one undocumented
       extended string capability (<B>set_pglen</B>).

       <B>SVr1,</B> <B>Ultrix</B> -- These support a restricted subset of  ter-
       minfo  capabilities.   The booleans end with <B>xon_xoff</B>; the
       numerics with  <B>width_status_line</B>;  and  the  strings  with
       <B>prtr_non</B>.

       <B>HP/UX</B>  --  Supports  the  SVr1  subset,  plus the SVr[234]
       numerics <B>num_labels</B>, <B>label_height</B>, <B>label_width</B>, plus func-
       tion  keys  11  through  63, plus <B>plab_norm</B>, <B>label_on</B>, and
       <B>label_off</B>, plus some incompatible extensions in the string
       table.

       <B>AIX</B>  --  Supports  the  SVr1 subset, plus function keys 11
       through 63, plus a number  of  incompatible  string  table
       extensions.

       <B>OSF</B>  -- Supports both the SVr4 set and the AIX extensions.
