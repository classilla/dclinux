This is the Debian/GNU Linux 'doc-linux' package. It provides the current
Linux-FAQ, written by Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk> as well as the
current Linux HOWTOs, written by several authors and coordinated by Greg
Hankins <gregh@cc.gatech.edu>.

This package was put together by Marco Budde <Budde@tu-harburg.de>
from the sources at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO and 
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/faqs/linux-faq.

No changes other than adding the Debian package maintenance system were made.

The copyright statement for the HOWTOs follows (that can also be found in
/usr/doc/copyright/doc-linux):

   Unless otherwise stated, Linux HOWTO documents are copyrighted by their
   respective authors. Linux HOWTO documents may be reproduced and distributed 
   in whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, as long as
   this copyright notice is retained on all copies. Commercial redistribution 
   is allowed and encouraged; however, the author would like to be notified of 
   any such distributions. 
   
   All translations, derivative works, or aggregate works incorporating

   In short, we wish to promote dissemination of this information through as
