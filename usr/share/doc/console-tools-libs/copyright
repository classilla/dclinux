This is the Debian-Linux prepackaged version of the Linux console font and
keytable utilities.  

This package was put together by Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>, from
sources you can get from:
 http://lct.sourceforge.net/


`console-tools' is a improved version of the kbd package.  It is
maintained by Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.

The Linux Console Tools are covered by the GPL
(see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL for details).

The copyright notice for the original `kbd' package tells that
loadkeys, dumpkeys and showkey were derived from Risto Kankkunen's
kbd-0.81.  The font loading code goes back to the codepage package by
Joel Hoffman (joel@wam.umd.edu).  (He told that the original reference
is: "From: p. 307 of _Programmer's Guide to PC & PS/2 Video Systems_
by Richard Wilton. 1987.  Microsoft Press".)  The kernel and user
interface for the font loading closely used to follow Eugene Crosser's
intl_con package, but that may not be true anymore.
