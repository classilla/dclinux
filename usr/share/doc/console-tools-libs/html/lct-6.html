<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Unicode is everywhere</A>
</H2>

<H3>Screen Font Maps</H3>

<P>In recent (as of 1998/08/11) kernels, the screen driver is based on
16-bit unicode (UCS2) encoding, which means that every console-font
loaded <B>should</B> be defined using a <EM>unicode Screen Font Map</EM>
(SFM for short), which tells, for each character in the font, the list
of UCS2 characters it will render.
<BLOCKQUOTE>SFM's were formerly called ``Unicode Map'', or ``unimap''
for short, but this term should be dropped, as now what they called
``screen maps'' uses Unicode as well: it probably confuses many many
people</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>SFM Fallback tables</H3>

<P>Starting with release 1997.11.13 of the Linux Console Tools, <CODE>consolechars(8)</CODE>
now understands <EM>SFM fallback tables</EM>.  Before that, SFM's should
contain at the same time the Unicode of the characters it was
primarily meant to render, as well as any approximations the user
would like to.  These fallback tables allow to only put the primary
mappings in the SFM provided with the font-file, and to
<EM>separately</EM> keep a list telling <EM>``if no glyph for that
character is available in the current font, then try to display it
with the glyph for this one, or else the one for that one, or
...''</EM>.  This permits to keep in one only place all possible
fallbacks, and everyone will be able to choose which fallback tables
(s)he wants.  Have a look at <CODE>data/consoletrans/*.fallback</CODE> for
examples.</P>
<P>A fallback-table file is made of fallback entries, each entry being on
its own line. Empty lines, and lines beginning with the <CODE>#</CODE>
comment character are ignored.</P>
<P>A fallback entry is a series of 2 or more UCS2 codes. The first one is
the character for which we want a glyph; the following ones are those
whose glyph we want to use when no glyph designed specially for our
character is available. The order of the codes defines a priority
order (own glyph if available, then second char's, then the third's,
etc.)</P>
<P>If a SFM was to be loaded, fallback mappings are added to this map
before it is loaded. If there was not (ie. a font without SFM was
loaded, and no <CODE>--sfm</CODE> option was given to <CODE>consolechars</CODE>, or
the <CODE>--force-no-sfm</CODE> option was given), then the current SFM is
requested from the kernel, the fallback mappings are added, and the
resulting SFM is loaded back into the kernel.</P>
<P>Note that each fallback entry is checked against the original SFM, not
against the SFM we get by adding former fallback entries to the
original SFM (the one read from a file, or given by the kernel); this
applies even to entries in different files, and thus the order of
<CODE>-k</CODE> options has no effect. If you want some entries to be
influenced by previous ones, you will have to use different fallback
files, and to load them with several consecutive invocations of
<CODE>consolechars -k</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 The unicode screen-mode</A>
</H2>

<P>There are basically 2 screen-modes (byte mode and UTF mode).  The
simpler to explain is the UTF mode, in which the bytes received from
the application (ie. written to the console screen) are interpreted as
UTF8 sequences, which are converted in the 
<A HREF="lct-4.html#sec-unicode">equivalent UCS2 codes</A>, and then looked-up in the SFM to
determine the glyphs used to display each character.</P>
<P>Switching to and from UTF mode is done by sending to the screen the
escape sequences <CODE>&lt;ESC&gt;%G</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;ESC&gt;%@</CODE>
respectively.  You may use the <CODE>unicode_start(1)</CODE> and
<CODE>unicode_stop(1)</CODE> scripts instead, as they also change the keyboard
mode, and let you optionally change the screen-font.</P>
<P>Use <CODE>vt-is-UTF8(1)</CODE> to find out whether active VT is in UTF mode.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 The byte screen-mode</A>
</H2>

<P>The byte mode is a bit more complicated, as it uses an additional map
to transform the byte-characters sent by the application into UCS2
characters, which are then treated as told above.  This map I call the
Application Charset Map (ACM), because it defines the encoding the
application uses, but it used to be called a ``screen map'', or
``console map'' (this comes from the time where the screen driver
didn't use Unicode, and there was only one Map down there).</P>
<P>Although there is only one ACM active at a given time, there are 4 of
them at any time in the kernel; 3 of them are built-in and never
change, and they define the ISO latin1 charset, the DEC VT100 charset,
and the IBM codepage 437; the 4th is user-definable, and defaults on
boot to the ``straight to font'' mapping, decribed below under
``Special UCS2 codes''.</P>
<P>The <CODE>consolechars(1)</CODE> command can be used to change the ACM, as
well as the font and its associated SFM.</P>

<H3>Charset slots</H3>

<P>The Linux Console Driver has 2 slots for charsets, labeled <EM>G0</EM> and
<EM>G1</EM>.  Each of these slots contains a reference to one of the 4
kernel ACMs, 3 of which are predefined to provide the <EM>cp437</EM>,
<EM>iso01</EM>, and <EM>vt100 graphics</EM> charsets.  The 4th one is
user-definable; this is the one you can set with <CODE>consolechars
--acm</CODE> and get with <CODE>consolechars --old-acm</CODE>.  The console's
defaults are <EM>iso01</EM> for <EM>G0</EM> and <EM>vt100 graphics</EM> for
<EM>G1</EM>.</P>
<P>Versions of the Linux Console Tools prior to 1998.08.11, as well as all versions of
<CODE>kbd</CODE> at least until 0.96a, were always assuming you wanted to use
the G0 slot, pointing to the user-defined ACM.  You can now use the
<CODE>charset</CODE> utility to tune your charset slots.</P>
<P>You will note that, although each VT has its own slot settings, there
is only one user-defined ACM for use by all the VTs.  That is, whereas
you can have tty1 using <EM>G0=cp437</EM> and <EM>G1=vt100</EM>, at the same
time as tty2 using <EM>G0=iso01</EM> and <EM>G1=iso02</EM> (user-defined), you
<B>cannot</B> have at the same time tty1 using <EM>iso02</EM> and tty2 using
<EM>iso03</EM>.  This is a limitation of the linux kernel.</P>
<P>Note that you can emulate such a setting using the <CODE>filterm</CODE>
utility, with your console in UTF8-mode, by telling <CODE>filterm</CODE> to
translate screen output on-the-fly to UTF8.</P>
<P>You'll find <B>filterm</B> in the <B>konwert</B> package, by Marcin
Kowalczyk, which is available from 
<A HREF="http://kki.net.pl/qrczak/programy/index.html">his WWW site</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Special UCS2 codes</A>
</H2>

<P>There are special UCS2 values you should care about, but the present
list is probably not exhaustive:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> codes <CODE>C</CODE> from <CODE>U+F000</CODE> to <CODE>U+F1FF</CODE> are not looked-up
in the SFM, and directly accesses the character in font-position <CODE>C
&amp; 0x01FF</CODE> (yes, a font can be 512-chars on many hardware
platforms, like VGA).  This is refered to as the <EM>straight to font</EM>
zone.
  </LI>
<LI>code <CODE>U+FFFD</CODE> is the <EM>replacement character</EM>, usually at
font-position 0 in a font.  It is displayed by the kernel each time
the application requested a unicode character that is not present in
the SFM.  This allows not only the driver to be safe in Unicode mode,
but also prevents displaying invalid characters when the ACM on a
particular VT contains characters not in the current font !</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 About the old 8-bit ``screen maps''</A>
</H2>

<P>There was a time where the kernel didn't know anything about Unicode.
In this ancient time, Application Charset Maps were called ``screen
maps'', and just mapped the application's characters into font
positions.  The file format used for these 8bit ACM's is still
supported for backward compatibility, but should not be used any more.</P>
<P>The old way of using custom ACM's didn't know about unicode, so the
ACM had to depend on the font.  Now, as each VT chooses its own ACM
(from the 4 ones in the kernel at a given time), and as the
console-font is common to all VT's, we can use a charset even if the
font can't display all of its characters; it will then display the
replacement character (<CODE>U+FFFD</CODE>).</P>
