This is the README file for console-tools version 0.2.3.

You may find more information at:

	http://www.multimania.com/ydirson/en/lct/


This package contains utilities compatible with kernel version 1.1.54
and later.  consolechars(1) requires 1.1.92 or later.

You will find the data files (keymaps, fonts, and unicode tables),
which used to be part of this package, in the console-data package.


To compile, you just need the standard make+gcc+libc suite.  To format
the docs, you'll need sgmltools (formerly linuxdoc-sgml).

It is mainly tested for libc 6.1 (aka glibc 2.1), so there may be
minor problems with libc5, or even libc 6.0.

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you still use libc5, you'll need a recent version.
5.4.33 and above seem to work fine, whereas 5.3.12 is know to have a
bug that causes problems to console-tools.


To install this package:

1) unpack it somewhere

2) invoke "./configure --help" to look at configuration parameters

2) invoke "./configure" with any chosen options

3) "make" and "make install". This copies by default the utilities to
/usr/bin, man pages to /usr/man/man? and data files to the subdirectories
keytables, consolefonts, consoletrans and videomodes of /usr/share/.


Then have a look at the `lct' document, available in the source
distribution as doc/lct.txt.
