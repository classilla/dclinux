e2fsprogs Debian TODO file as of 1.10-13.
This file may or may not be up to date.

* Report to Ted: inconsistent "et/com_err.h", <et/com_err.h>, <com_err.h>
  under lib/
* What about making com_err more self-consistant ("et" / "com_err")

* Suppress as many references as possible to the libcom_err version number in
  source control files and debian/ subdir.

* Maybe make -dbg packages. Look at how others do it.

* Fix com_err.texinfo.
