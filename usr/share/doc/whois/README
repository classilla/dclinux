Why another whois client? Because the RIPE client is a mess of hacks and
#ifdefs and more complex programs lack features or are bloated.

Notes about the data files:
- domain names MUST be lowercase and MUST begin with "." or "-".
- first match wins (for both domains and netblocks)
- elements in tld_serv_list are matched against the end of the query

Please send me any information you have regarding domains and netblocks
not correctly handled by the program.

Please also try to compile after defining HAVE_GETADDRINFO and send me
working #defines for your flavour of UNIX.
