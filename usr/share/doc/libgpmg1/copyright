This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of the General Purpose
Mouse Interface utility. The general purpose mouse daemon tries to be
a useful mouse server for applications running on the Linux console.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from the sources, which I obtained from

<URL:ftp://ftp.prosa.it:/pub/gpm/>

The changes were minor :-

- adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
- gpm.c (processConn): type of socket length changed (size_t -> socklen_t).
- debuglog.c: #include <string.h> to quiet -Wall.
- doc/Makefile.in (maintainer-clean): clean without interaction and
  clean all relevant files (i.e. gpm.info-{1,2}).
- doc/Makefile.in: add support for mouse-test.1.

The following changes were thought of and done mostly by François
Gouget <fgouget@mygale.org>; though I didn't apply his patches as
they were for various reasons:

- gpn.c (cmdline): modified handling of -t command line argument, so it
  can be used by anyone regardless of whether or not a copy of gpm is
  already running.
- gpn.c (usage): update for new -t option "types".
- mice.c: improved descriptions of mouse types.
- mice.c (M_listMice): function used by -t help, reworked version of
  old M_listTypes.
- mice.c (M_listTypes): function used by -t types; lists only
  mnemonics.
