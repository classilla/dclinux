This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU find, xargs
and locate.  GNU find was originally written by Eric Decker, with
enhancements by David MacKenzie, Jay Plett and Tim Wood.  GNU xargs
was originally written by Mike Rendell, with enhancements by David
MacKenzie.  GNU locate and its associated utilities were originally
written by James Woods, with enhancements by David MacKenzie.  The
idea for `find -print0' and `xargs -0' came from Dan Bernstein.

This package was put together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from:
 ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu/findutils-4.1.tar.gz

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * added cron script to update `find.codes' database daily
 * fixed locate, and removed declaration of various string functions
 * add "--existing" option to locate to ignore files which no longer exist
