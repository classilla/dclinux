This is the Debian prepackaged version of the GNU gettext utilities.
GNU gettext was written by Ulrich Drepper <drepper@gnu.org>.
emacs po-mode was written by François Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

This package was first created by Erick Branderhorst <branderh@debian.org>,
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.

This release has been built using the sources from:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.10.36.tar.gz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.


This is a test release of GNU gettext. Please do not send reports about
this release to any GNU mailing list or newsgroup. Use the Debian bug
tracking system, as usual :-) Of course you can still send comments and
problems to the upstream maintainers, Ulrich Drepper <drepper@gnu.org>
and Bruno Haible <haible@clisp.cons.org>, if you think the problem has
nothing to do with the Debian packaging.
