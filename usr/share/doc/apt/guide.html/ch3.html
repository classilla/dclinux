章 3 DSelect
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The APT <code>dselect</code> method provides the complete APT system with the
<code>dselect</code> package selection GUI.  <code>dselect</code> is used to
select the packages to be installed or removed and APT actually installs them.

<p>
To enable the APT method you need to to select [A]ccess in <code>dselect</code>
and then choose the APT method.  You will be prompted for a set of
<em>Sources</em> which are places to fetch archives from.  These can be remote
Internet sites, local Debian mirrors or CDROMs.  Each source can provide a
fragment of the total Debian archive, APT will automatically combine them to
form a complete set of packages.  If you have a CDROM then it is a good idea to
specify it first and then specify a mirror so that you have access to the
latest bug fixes.  APT will automatically use packages on your CDROM before
downloading from the Internet.

<pre>
        Set up a list of distribution source locations
     	 
      Please give the base URL of the debian distribution.
      The access schemes I know about are: http file
     	   
      For example:
           file:/mnt/debian,
           ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian,
           http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian,
           
           
      URL [http://llug.sep.bnl.gov/debian]:
</pre>

<p>
The <em>Sources</em> setup starts by asking for the base of the Debian archive,
defaulting to a HTTP mirror.  Next it asks for the distribution to get.

<pre>
      Please give the distribution tag to get or a path to the
      package file ending in a /. The distribution
      tags are typically something like: stable unstable frozen non-US
        
      Distribution [stable]:
</pre>

<p>
The distribution refers to the Debian version in the archive, <em>stable</em>
refers to the latest released version and <em>unstable</em> refers to the
developmental version.  <em>non-US</em> is only available on some mirrors and
refers to packages that contain encryption technology or other things that
cannot be exported from the United States.  Importing these packages into the
US is legal however.

<pre>
      Please give the components to get
      The components are typically something like: main contrib non-free
       
      Components [main contrib non-free]:
</pre>

<p>
The components list refers to the list of sub distributions to fetch.  The
distribution is split up based on software licenses, main being DFSG free
packages while contrib and non-free contain things that have various
restrictions placed on their use and distribution.

<p>
Any number of sources can be added, the setup script will continue to prompt
until you have specified all that you want.

<p>
Before starting to use <code>dselect</code> it is necessary to update the
available list by selecting [U]pdate from the menu.  This is a super-set of
<samp>apt-get update</samp> that makes the fetched information available to
<code>dselect</code>.  [U]pdate must be performed even if <samp>apt-get
update</samp> has been run before.

<p>
You can then go on and make your selections using [S]elect and then perform the
installation using [I]nstall.  When using the APT method the [C]onfig and
[R]emove commands have no meaning, the [I]nstall command performs both of them
together.

<p>
By default APT will automatically remove the package (.deb) files once they
have been successfully installed.  To change this behavior place
<samp>Dselect::clean &quot;prompt&quot;;</samp> in /etc/apt/apt.conf.
