nano for Debian
----------------------

Nano should provide a good replacement for the Pico package in Debian, given
Pico's non-freeness. Maybe you want to create a symlink for Pico that points
to Nano and uninstall the original Pico package. If Nano is invoked as
"pico", it will start up in the "pico compatibility mode", which will aid in
this change.
