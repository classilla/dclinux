This is the set of GNU shar utilities.

`shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services.  `unshar' helps
unpacking shell archives after reception.  The core of both programs
is initially derived from public domain.  Some modules and other
code sections are freely borrowed from other GNU distributions,
bringing `shar' under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

`uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic channel
which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high order bit) of
bytes.  `uudecode' does the converse transformation.  They are derived
from the BSD NET/2 distribution, but enchanced with the features
described in recent POSIX standards.  If you have more powerful
`uuencode' and `uudecode' already available, you may want to use
`./configure --disable-uucode' to prevent their installation.

`remsync' allows for remote synchronization of directory trees,
using electronic mail.  This part of sharutils is still alpha.
You should have already installed Perl, gzip, GNU diff, GNU tar
and GNU shar prior to installing remsync package.  Only Perl is
really mandatory, write to me if you feel like helping to remove
the other dependencies.

Beside the Perl script `remsync' and its shell scripts the whole
package now is internationalized.  This includes the generated shell
scripts.  As described in the `ABOUT-NLS' file you have various
options for handling this internationalization but this package is
special in one point: it always needs the GNU message catalog files to
be installed.  Therefore it might be a good idea to always use the GNU
gettext functions and not the functions provided by your system.  This
is of course not needed if your system uses GNU gettext in its system
library.

See file `ABOUT-NLS' for how to customize this program to your language.
See file `BACKLOG' for a summary of pending mail and articles.
See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions.
See file `NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release.
See file `THANKS' for a list of contributors.

Jan Djarv takes care of the man pages, otherwise unsupported, and
their installation is kept separate from `make install'.  You use
`make install-man' for them.  Better think GNU and switch to Info.

Your feedback will help us to make a better and more portable
product.  Mail suggestions and bug reports (including documentation
errors) for this program to `bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.
