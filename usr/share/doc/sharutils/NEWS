Version 4.2 - November 1995, by François Pinard & Ulrich Drepper

* New `mailshar' is a wrapper around `shar' and electronic mail.

* New `remsync' is a Perl script which uses `mailshar' to help
synchronizing remote directories, for sites connected only by email.

* Programs (but not scripts) may now speak Dutch, French, German
and Swedish.

* Option -o offers better control over where to insert the part numbering
in the file name.

* There are the beginnings of a contrib directory.

* Produced shell archive are now internationalized, too

* uuencode/uudecode are now compliant to the latest POSIX.2d draft
  (more options, new encoding).

* Updated man pages for shar/unshar by Jan Djarv

* Speed up unshar a little bit.

* Protect against transmission error by using MD5 sum.  The old wc sum
  is more or less useless, but still the fallback solution.

Version 4.1 - November 1994, by François Pinard

* GNU shar 4.0 and GNU uuencode 1.0 distributions have been merged
into this GNU sharutils package, which replaces both.  So this release
introduces `uuencode' and `uudecode', over `shar' and `unshar'.

* Option --no-verbose (-v) is being replaced by two different options:
first is --quiet or --silent (-q), second is --quiet-unshar (-Q).

Version 4.0 - September 1994, by François Pinard

* The distribution includes a Texinfo manual and Info documentation.
Jan Djarv updated the man pages.

* Mixed mode (-M) mode works reliably and is the default, intermixing
types within file lists (-p) allows `-M'.

* When piping is forbidden (-P), the shar scripts are usable by
uudecode's requiring an argument as well as by those unable to
process one.

* Interactive scripts (-X) better protect themselves against
`unshar' programs and procedures.  The query format is nicer.

Version 3.52.3 - July 1994, by François Pinard

* --gzip (-z) replaces --gzipped-files (-G).  --compress (-Z)
replaces --compressed-files (-C).  -C is kept for a while, but
gives a warning about being deprecated.

Version 3.52.2 - July 1994, by François Pinard

* Long options, among which --help and --version.

* Tildas are protected at the beginning of a line.

* Setting timestamps is attempted by default, using an improved
check of the local `touch' program at unshar time.

* Generated shar scripts are cleaner on various details.

Version 3.52.1 - June 1994, by François Pinard

* New options -G and -g<N> to use gzip while making shar files.

See file `ChangeLog.OLD' for prior history about shar and unshar.
