This program is a very basic interface to DNS listings such as the RBL
filter developed by Paul Vixie and the MAPS project. The basic idea of the
filter is that when someone is blacklisted for email abuse of some sort, a
new domain name is resolved of the form "2.0.0.127.domain.name.com", where
2.0.0.127 is the abusive IP address in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127
would be the IP address 127.0.0.2), and "domain.name.com" is the base
domain name of the filtering service (such as "rbl.maps.vix.com", for the
MAPS project RBL filter).

For information on compiling this program, see the file docs/INSTALL. For
generic information on using the supplied "configure" script, see the file
INSTALL.

This program has only been tested by the author under Linux 2.x, Solaris
2.5.1, and Solaris 2.6, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on another
platform, as long as a working resolver library exists (the one from BIND
will do perfectly).

For more information about RBL-style blacklists, please see the "sites.h"
file, which contains pointers to several RBL-alike listings.

Any ideas, bugfixes, porting notes, or requests for pizza delivery
directions should be sent to me at "emarshal@logic.net". Don't bug the
RBL service operators about it, since they didn't write it, and probably
wouldn't like doing technical support for it.
