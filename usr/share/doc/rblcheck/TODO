- follow CNAMEs from rblcheck(). This will let us get at the eventual
  TXT RRs for a domain name.

- an option to "exit on first match", so that after the first failure,
  further checks are skipped, speeding up rejection if there is no
  interest in the specifics of the results.

- timeout option. Should default to no timeout, but apparently there is
  an issue with rblcheck hanging in an offline environment where the
  nameserver in use is located off-site. This would compensate for the
  misconfiguration, and provide a 'quick-fail' mode for people to play
  with.

- (from Aaron Schrab <aaron@schrab.com>, era eriksson <era@iki.fi>, and
  torben fjerdingstad <tfj@fjerdingstad.dk>) Add the ability to only list
  successful matches, and add a debug mode which outputs what is happening
  internally, and any errors received. This could be best implemented with
  a '-v X' option, where 'X' is a number between 0 and 9 (0 being silent,
  4 being default/ordinary output, 9 displaying heavy debugging info).

Send ideas to "emarshal@logic.net".
