These are examples, templates etc. for some scripts in /etc/init.d/

Some of them are not really "examples" but I had to stuff some default

Concerning the powerfail and powerd stuff,
it is best if you install the "genpower" package maintained by
Brian C. White <bcwhite@verisim.com> if you want to use a UPS.
