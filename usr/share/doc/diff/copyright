The manpages were obtained from the FreeBSD-stable sources located at
ftp.cdrom.com.  They appear to have originally been under the Berkeley
copyright notice quoted in cmp.1, and to have been subsequently placed
under the GNU Public License by FreeBSD.  They appear to have been
written to describe diff-2.6.
