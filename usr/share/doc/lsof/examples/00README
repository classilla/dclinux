	    Notes on Using the Scripts in This Subdirectory

The scripts in this subdirectory are examples of post-processing
lsof field output.  They are written in AWK, Perl 4 (4.036), and
Perl 5 (5.001e through 5.006).  AWK scripts have a suffix of
``.awk''; Perl 4 (which will work uder Perl 5) scripts have a
``.perl4'' suffix; and Perl 5 scripts, ``.perl''.

Supply AWK scripts to your AWK interpreter with its -f option.  Supply
lsof field output via a pipe -- e.g.,

	lsof -F | awk -f list_fields.awk

The Perl scripts use the Unix command interpreter line feature to
specify the location of Perl -- i.e., the first line begins with
``#!'' and the path to the Perl interpreter follows.  If your system
supports the command interpreter feature, but your Perl interpreters
have different paths to them, just change the interpreter lines in
the scripts.  These scripts assume:

	Path to:	Is:
	=======		==

	Perl 4		/usr/local/bin/perl4

	Perl 5		/usr/local/bin/perl

If your system doesn't support the command interpreter feature,
you'll have to supply the scripts to your Perl interpreter on its
command line -- e.g.,

	lsof -F | /<path_to_your_perl_4> list_fields.perl

Some scripts also declare a path to lsof -- e.g., the count_pf.perl*
ones -- as ``../lsof'' on the assumption that you'll run them from
the scripts subdirectory and that an lsof executable is in ``../lsof''.
If those assumptions are incorrect for you, you'll have to modify
the scripts.
