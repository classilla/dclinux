lsof for DEBIAN
----------------------

Comments regarding the Package

Compiled with the HASSECURITY option enabled meaning you can only see
open files for your own processes.

As of this version of the debian package 2.0.x kernels are no longer
supported.  This version uses the /proc filesystem and should work on
any kernel 2.2.x or 2.4.x.
