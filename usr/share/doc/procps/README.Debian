README for Debian package of procps
===================================

XConsole gone
-------------
 XConsole and other X-based programs have been finally removed.  Look in
 the x packages for their equivalents.

pgrep
-----
pgrep is a new program, using the Unix standard name for something that
greps for processes.  If you are looking for Perl compatible regular
expression grep, it is called pcregrep.
