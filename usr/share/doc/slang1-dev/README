**** Note: If you are upgrading from previous 1.0 BETA versions, you
           may need to recompile your applications if they are
	   dynamically linked to a BETA version.  Failure to do so may
	   result in a core-dump of your application.

**** Note: If you are upgrading from version 0.99-XX, read UPGRADE.txt
           for important information.

Installation instructions:

S-Lang has been successfully compiled and tested on many platforms and OSs
(Unix/VMS/PC-MSDOS/OS2).  Building the S-Lang library requires a C compiler
that understands function prototypes.  On SunOS, you will need gcc.

  VMS: INSTALL.vms
  OS/2, MSDOS, see: INSTALL.pc
  Unix: see INSTALL.unx

See doc/README for more information.
