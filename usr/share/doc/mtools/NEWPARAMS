Attention:

Since version xxx, certain parameters have changed, in order to more
closely match the parameters in MS-DOS:


*) Filename clash options are now introduced by -D <option> instead of
just -<option> in order to free up the option letters used by MS-DOS
I.e. use `mcopy -D o toto a:' rather than `mcopy -o toto a:' to copy
toto to a: and overwrite any a:toto file that already exists.

*) Recursive operation is now introduced by -s instead of -/.
Exception: mattrib still uses -/, because -s is already taken to mean
"remove system flag".

*) mdir "batch" listing has now option -b

*) mformat

   - now uses -L for the fat length, because -f is now taken for size
   - now uses -n for number of sectors, rather than -s
   - now uses -N to set a given serial number rather than -n
   - now uses -v to set the volume label, rather than -l
   - now uses -3 to say "don't use 2m mode" rather than -1
   - now supports MS-DOS' option -1, -4, and -8
