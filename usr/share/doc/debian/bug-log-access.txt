               Accessing bug reports in the tracking system logs

   Each message received at or sent by the bug processing system is
   logged and made available in a number of ways.

   Copies of the logs are available on the World Wide Web at
   http://www.infodrom.north.de/Debian/Bugs/,
   http://www.nl.debian.org/Bugs/ and
   http://www.debian.org/Bugs/

   There is a mailserver which can send bug reports as plain text on
   request. To use it send the word help as the sole contents of an email
   to request@bugs.debian.org (the Subject of the message is ignored), or
   read the instructions on the World Wide Web or in the file
   bug-log-mailserver.txt.
