The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ<br>
Chapter 4 Software available in the Debian system
</h1>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-apps">4.1 What types of applications and development software are available for Debian GNU/Linux?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Like most Linux distributions, Debian GNU/Linux provides:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
the major GNU applications for software development, file manipulation, and
text processing, including gcc, g++, make, texinfo, Emacs, the Bash shell and
numerous upgraded Unix utilities,
</li>

<p>
<li>
Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and various related programs, modules and libraries for
each of them,
</li>

<p>
<li>
TeX (LaTeX) and Lyx, dvips, Ghostscript,
</li>

<p>
<li>
the X Window System, which provides a networked graphical user interface for
Linux, and countless X applications including GNOME,
</li>

<p>
<li>
a full suite of networking applications, including servers for Internet
protocols such as HTTP (WWW), FTP, NNTP (news), SMTP and POP (mail) and name
server; also provided are web browsers, and development tools.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
More than 3750 packages, ranging from news servers and readers to sound
support, FAX programs, database and spreadsheet programs, image processing
programs, communications, net, and mail utilities, Web servers, and even
ham-radio programs are included in the distribution.  Another 450 software
suites are available as Debian packages, but are not formally part of Debian
due to license restrictions.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-softwareauthors">4.2 Who wrote all that software?</a>
</h2>

<p>
For each package the <em>authors</em> of the program(s) are credited in the
file <samp>/usr/doc/PACKAGE/copyright</samp>, where PACKAGE is to be
substituted with the package's name.

<p>
<em>Maintainers</em> who package this software for the Debian GNU/Linux system
are listed in the Debian control file (see <a
href="ch-pkg_basics.html#s-controlfile">What is a Debian control file?, Section
6.4</a>) that comes with each package.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-pkglist">4.3 How can I get a current list of programs that have been packaged for the Debian project?</a>
</h2>

<p>
A complete list is available from any of the Debian <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">mirrors</a></code>.

<p>
The file <samp>indices/Packages-Master-i386.gz</samp> provides a list,
including short descriptions, of all packages that are available for computers
with ix86 (and compatible) chips.  There are similar files, at
<samp>indices/Packages-Master-ARCH.gz</samp>, where ARCH is to be substituted
by the appropriate architecture, that provide a similar list of packages that
are available for such computers/architectures.

<p>
The <code><a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages.html">WWW interface
to the Debian packages</a></code> conveniently summarizes the packages in each
of about twenty &quot;sections&quot; of the Debian archive.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-no-devs">4.4 Why aren't there any libfoo.so files in Debian library packages?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Debian Policy requires that such symbolic links (to libfoo.so.x.y.z or similar)
are placed in separate, development packages.  Those packages are usually named
libfoo-dev or libfooX-dev (presuming the library package is named libfooX, and
X is a whole number).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-missing">4.5 What is missing from Debian GNU/Linux?</a>
</h2>

<p>
A list of packages which are still needed to be packaged for Debian exists, the
&quot;Work-Needing and Prospective Packages&quot; list.  For more details, see
<a href="ch-contributing.html#s-contrib">How can I become a Debian software
developer?, Section 12.1</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-java">4.6 (How) Does Debian support Java?</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Java Development Kit from Sun is currently available as a Debian package
(<samp>jdkVVV_VVV-RRR.deb</samp>).  The JDK will allow you to run Java programs
and applets, and write your own.  If your kernel is properly configured (see
below), the JDK will allow you to <em>run</em> Java programs just like other
executables.  The JDK package also includes a number of demo programs.

<p>
Debian's default kernel is configured with Java support built in as a module
(i.e., CONFIG_BINFMT_JAVA=m).  Users who wish to build their own custom kernel
(see <a href="ch-kernel.html#s-customkernel">What tools does Debian provide to
build custom kernels?, Section 9.2</a>) can omit this if they choose, of
course.  Once module support is available in the kernel, you need to make sure
the module is loaded.  You can do it at boot time by inserting the line
<samp>binfmt_java</samp> in the file <samp>/etc/modules</samp>.

<p>
Alternatively, you can install the module from the command line by executing
the command <samp>insmod DIRNAME/binfmt_java.o</samp> where
<samp>DIRNAME</samp> is the name of the directory where the modules that have
been built for the version of the kernel now running are stored.  On a system
with the 2.2.17 version of the kernel, <samp>DIRNAME</samp> is likely to be
<samp>/lib/modules/2.2.17/fs/</samp>.  You can check that a module is loaded
using the command <samp>lsmod</samp>.

<p>
Running a Java applet requires a browser with the capability to recognize and
execute them.  The Netscape browser that can be installed as a Debian package
will run Java applets.  (The Netscape source code is not publicly available.
The Debian netscape package provides a wrapper which aids the installation and
management of Netscape on a Debian system.  This is actually a good example of
the integration of commercial packages with the Debian system.)

<p>
A final note of mixed blessings: Sun's licensing policies on the JDK are
becoming more restricted with time, so this package may not be available as
part of Debian soon.  It is possible that it may be available in the same way
that Netscape is available for Debian GNU/Linux.  Better news is that a number
of programs are currently being developed with may provide attractive
publicly-available alternatives.

<h2>
<a name="s-isitdebian">4.7 How can I check that I am using a Debian system, and what version is it?</a>
</h2>

<p>
In order to make sure that your system has been installed from the real Debian
base disks check for the existence of <samp>/etc/debian_version</samp> file,
which contains a single one-line entry giving the version number of the
release, as defined by the package <samp>base-files</samp>.

<p>
The existence of the program <samp>dpkg</samp> shows that you should be able to
install Debian packages on your system, but as the program has been ported to
many other operating systems and architectures, this is no longer a reliable
method of determining is a system Debian GNU/Linux.

<p>
Users should be aware, however, that the Debian system consists of many parts,
each of which can be updated (almost) independently.  Each Debian
&quot;release&quot; contains well defined and unchanging contents.  Updates are
separately available.  For a one-line description of the installation status of
package <samp>foo</samp>, use the command <samp>dpkg --list foo</samp>.  To
view versions of all installed packages, run:

<pre>
     dpkg -l
</pre>

<p>
For a more verbose description, use:

<pre>
     dpkg --status foo
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-nonenglish">4.8 How does Debian support non-English languages?</a>
</h2>

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Debian GNU/Linux is distributed with keymaps for nearly two dozen keyboards,
and with utilities (in the <samp>kbd</samp> package) to install, view, and
modify the tables.

<p>
The installation prompts the user to specify the keyboard he will use.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Vast majority of the software we packaged supports entering non-US-ASCII
characters used in other Latin languages (e.g.  ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-2), and
a number of programs support multi-byte languages such as Japanese or Chinese.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Currently, support for German-, Spanish-, Finnish-, French-, Hungarian-,
Italian-, Japanese-, Korean- and Polish-language manual pages is provided
through the <samp>manpages-LANG</samp> packages (where LANG is the ISO country
code).  To access an NLS manual page, the user must set the shell LC_MESSAGES
variable to the appropriate string.

<p>
For example, in the case of the Italian-language manual pages, LC_MESSAGES must
be set to 'it_IT'.  The <code>man</code> program will then search for Italian
manual pages under <samp>/usr/share/man/it_IT/</samp>.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-usexports">4.9 What about the US export regulation limitations?</a>
</h2>

<p>
US laws place restrictions on the export of defense articles, which includes
some types of cryptographic software.  PGP and ssh, among others, fall into
this category.

<p>
To prevent anyone from taking unnecessary legal risks, certain Debian GNU/Linux
packages are only available from a non-US site <code><a
href="ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/">ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/</a></code>.
There are numerous mirror sites all of which are also outside of the US, see
<code><a
href="ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/README.non-US">ftp://non-US.debian.org/debian-non-US/README.non-US</a></code>
for a full list.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-pine">4.10 Where is pine?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Due to its restrictive license, it's in the non-free area.  Moreover, since
license does not even allow modified binaries to be distributed, you have to
compile it yourself from the source and the Debian patches.  For the
convenience of people using dselect, the source code for the Debian version of
pine is available in the packages <code>pine396-src</code> and
<code>pine396-diffs</code>, or <code>pine4-src</code> and
<code>pine4-diffs</code> for version 4.*.

<p>
Note that there are many replacements for both pine and pico, such as
<code>mutt</code> and <code>nano</code>, that are located in the main section.
