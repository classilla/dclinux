<h1>
The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ<br>
Chapter 5 The Debian FTP archives
</h1>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-dirtree">5.1 What are all those directories at the Debian FTP archives?</a>
</h2>

<p>
The software that has been packaged for Debian GNU/Linux is available in one of
several directory trees on each Debian mirror site.

<p>
The directory <samp>dists</samp> contains the &quot;distributions&quot;, and it
is the canonical way to access the currently available Debian releases (and
pre-releases).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-dists">5.2 How many Debian distributions are there in the <samp>dists</samp> directory?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Normally there are two distributions, the &quot;stable&quot; distribution and
the &quot;unstable&quot; distribution.  Sometimes there is also a
&quot;frozen&quot; distribution (see <a
href="ch-ftparchives.html#s-frozen">What about &quot;frozen&quot;?, Section
5.4</a>).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-codenames">5.3 What are all those names like slink, potato, etc.?</a>
</h2>

<p>
They are just &quot;codenames&quot;.  When a Debian distribution is in the
development stage, it has no version number but a codename.  The purpose of
these codenames is to make easier the mirroring of the Debian distributions (if
a real directory like <samp>unstable</samp> suddenly changed its name to
<samp>stable</samp>, a lot of stuff would have to be needlessly downloaded
again).

<p>
Currently, <samp>stable</samp> is a symlink to <samp>potato</samp> (i.e.
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2) and <samp>unstable</samp> is a symlink to
<samp>woody</samp>, which means that <samp>potato</samp> is the current stable
distribution and <samp>woody</samp> is the current unstable distribution.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-frozen">5.4 What about &quot;frozen&quot;?</a>
</h2>

<p>
When the unstable distribution is mature enough, it becomes frozen, meaning no
new code is accepted anymore, just bugfixes, if necessary.  Also, a new
unstable tree is created in the <samp>dists</samp> directory, having a new
codename.  The frozen distribution passes through a few months of testing, with
intermittent updates and deep freezes called `test cycles'.  We keep a record
of bugs in the frozen distribution that can hold off a package from being
released or bugs that can hold back the whole release.  Once that bug count
lowers to maximum acceptable values, the frozen distribution becomes stable, it
is released, and the previous stable distribution becomes obsolete (and moves
to the archive).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-oldcodenames">5.5 Which other codenames have been used in the past?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Other codenames that have been already used are: <samp>buzz</samp> for release
1.1, <samp>rex</samp> for release 1.2, <samp>bo</samp> for releases 1.3.x,
<samp>hamm</samp> for release 2.0, and <samp>slink</samp> for release 2.1.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-sourceforcodenames">5.6 Where do these codenames come from?</a>
</h2>

<p>
So far they have been characters taken from the movie &quot;Toy Story&quot; by
Pixar.

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<em>buzz</em> (Buzz Lightyear) was the spaceman,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<em>rex</em> was the tyrannosaurus,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<em>bo</em> (Bo Peep) was the girl who took care of the sheep,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<em>hamm</em> was the piggy bank,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<em>slink</em> (Slinky Dog) was the toy dog,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<em>potato</em> was, of course, Mr. Potato,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<em>woody</em> was the cowboy.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-sid">5.7 What about &quot;sid&quot;?</a>
</h2>

<p>
It is a special distribution for architectures which haven't yet been released
for the first time.

<p>
When sid did not exist, the FTP site organization had one major flaw: there was
an assumption that when an architecture is created in the current unstable, it
will be released when that distribution becomes the new stable.  For many
architectures that isn't the case, with the result that those directories had
to be moved at release time, chewing up lots of bandwidth.

<p>
For those architectures not yet released, the first time they are released
there will be a link from the current stable to sid, and from then on they will
be created inside the unstable tree as normal.  sid will never be released nor
even accessed directly - only through symlinks in the current stable, frozen,
or unstable trees.  It is a mix of released and unreleased architectures.

<p>
The name &quot;sid&quot; also comes from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; animated
motion picture: Sid was the boy next door who destroyed toys :-)
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-stable">5.8 What does the stable directory contain?</a>
</h2>

<ul>

<p>
<li>
stable/main/: This directory contains the packages which formally constitute
the most recent release of the Debian GNU/Linux system.

<p>
These packages all comply with the <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a></code>, and are all freely usable and distributable.
</li>

<p>
<li>
stable/non-free/: This directory contains packages distribution of which is
restricted in a way that requires that distributors take careful account of the
specified copyright requirements.

<p>
For example, some packages have licenses which prohibit commercial
distribution.  Others can be redistributed but are in fact shareware and not
freeware.  The licenses of each of these packages must be studied, and possibly
negotiated, before the packages are included in any redistribution (e.g., in a
CD-ROM).
</li>

<p>
<li>
stable/contrib/: This directory contains packages which are DFSG-free and
<em>freely distributable</em> themselves, but somehow depend on a package that
is <em>not</em> freely distributable and thus available only in the non-free
section.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-unstable">5.9 What does the unstable directory contain?</a>
</h2>

<p>
The `unstable' directory contains a snapshot of the current development system.
Users are welcome to use and test these packages, but are warned about their
state of readiness.  The advantage of using the unstable distribution is that
you are always up-to-date with the latest in GNU/Linux software industry, but
if it breaks: you get to keep both parts :-)

<p>
There are also main, contrib and non-free subdirectories in `unstable',
separated on the same criteria as in `stable'.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-archsections">5.10 What are all those directories inside <samp>dists/stable/main</samp>?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Within each of the major directory trees (<samp>dists/stable/main</samp>,
<samp>dists/stable/contrib</samp>, <samp>dists/stable/non-free</samp>, and
<samp>dists/unstable/main/</samp>, etc.  but not
<samp>project/experimental/</samp>, which is too small to subdivide), the
binary packages reside in sub-directories whose names indicate the chip
architecture for which they were compiled:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
binary-all/, for packages which are architecture-independent.  These include,
for example, Perl scripts, or pure documentation.
</li>

<p>
<li>
binary-i386/, for packages which execute on 80x86 PC machines.
</li>

<p>
<li>
binary-m68k/, for packages which execute on machines based on one of the
Motorola 680x0 processors.  Currently this is done mainly for Atari and Amiga
computers, and also for some VME based industry standard boards.
</li>

<p>
<li>
binary-sparc/, for packages which execute on Sun SPARCStations.
</li>

<p>
<li>
binary-alpha/, for packages which execute on DEC Alpha machines.
</li>

<p>
<li>
binary-powerpc/, for packages which execute on PowerPC machines.
</li>

<p>
<li>
binary-arm/, for packages which execute on ARM machines.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
See <a href="ch-compat.html#s-arches">On what hardware architectures/systems
does Debian GNU/Linux run?, Section 3.1</a> for more information.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-source">5.11 Where is the source code?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Source code is included for everything in the Debian system.  Moreover, the
license terms of most programs in the system <em>require</em> that source code
be distributed along with the programs, or that an offer to provide the source
code accompany the programs.

<p>
Normally the source code is distributed in the &quot;source&quot; directories,
which are parallel to all the architecture-specific binary directories.

<p>
Source code may or may not be available for packages in the &quot;contrib&quot;
and &quot;non-free&quot; directories, which are not formally part of the Debian
system.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-otherdirs">5.12 Ok, what about the other directories, not inside <samp>dists</samp>?</a>
</h2>

<p>
There are the following supplementary directories:

<dl>

<p>
<dt><em>/tools/</em>:</dt>
<dd>
DOS utilities for creating boot disks, partitioning your disk drive,
compressing/decompressing files, and booting Linux.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><em>/doc/</em>:</dt>
<dd>
Debian documentation, Debian FAQ, instructions on how to submit bug reports.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><em>/indices/</em>:</dt>
<dd>
Various indices, maintainers, Packages-master files, override files.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><em>/project/</em>:</dt>
<dd>
mostly developer-only materials, such as:

<dl>

<p>
<dt><em>project/experimental/</em>:</dt>
<dd>
This directory contains packages and tools which are still being developed, and
are still in the alpha testing stage.  Users shouldn't be using packages from
here, because they can be dangerous and harmful even for most experienced
people.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><em>project/orphaned/</em>:</dt>
<dd>
Packages that have been orphaned by their old maintainers, and withdrawn from
the distribution.
</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

</dl>
