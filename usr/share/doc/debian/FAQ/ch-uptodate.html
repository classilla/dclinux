The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ<br>
Chapter 8 Keeping Your Debian System Up To Date
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
One of Debian goals is to provide a consistant upgrade path and a secure
upgrade process, and we always do our best to make the new release smoothly
upgradable from the previous ones.  In case there's some important note to add
to the upgrade process, the packages will alert the user, and often provide a
solution to a possible problem.

<p>
You should also read the Release Notes, document that describes the details of
specific upgrades, shipped on all Debian CDs, and available on the WWW at
<code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/</a></code>.

<h2>
<a name="s-libc5to6upgrade">8.1 How can I upgrade my Debian 1.3.1 (or earlier) distribution, based on libc5, to 2.0 (or later), based on libc6?</a>
</h2>

<p>
There are several ways to upgrade:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Using a simple shell script called <samp>autoup.sh</samp> which upgrades the
most important packages.  After <samp>autoup.sh</samp> has done his job, you
may use dselect to install the remaining packages <em>en masse</em>.  This is
probably the recommended method, but not the only one.

<p>
Currently, the latest release of <samp>autoup.sh</samp> may be found on the
following locations:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/2.0/autoup/">http://www.debian.org/releases/2.0/autoup/</a></code>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<code><a
href="http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/">http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/</a></code>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<code><a
href="http://csanders.vicnet.net.au/autoup/">http://csanders.vicnet.net.au/autoup/</a></code>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<p>
<li>
Following closely the <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/doc/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.txt">libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO</a></code>
and upgrade the most important packages by hand.  <samp>autoup.sh</samp> is
based on this Mini-HOWTO, so this method should work more or less like using
<samp>autoup.sh</samp>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Using a libc5-based <samp>apt</samp>.  APT stands for A Package Tool, and it
might replace dselect some day.  Currently, it works just as a command-line
interface, or as a dselect access method.  You will find a libc5 version in the
<samp>dists/slink/main/upgrade-older-i386</samp> directory at the Debian
archives.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Using just dselect, without upgrading any package by hand first.  It is highly
recommended that you do NOT use this method if you can avoid it, because
dselect alone currently does not install packages in the optimal order.  APT
works much better and it is safer.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-howtocurrent">8.2 How can I keep my Debian system current?</a>
</h2>

<p>
One could simply execute an anonymous ftp call to a Debian archive, then peruse
the directories until he finds the desired file, and then fetch it, and finally
install it using <samp>dpkg</samp>.  Note that <samp>dpkg</samp> will install
upgrade files in place, even on a running system.  Sometimes, a revised package
will require the installation of a newly revised version of another package, in
which case the installation will fail until/unless the other package is
installed.

<p>
Many people find this approach much too time-consuming, since Debian evolves so
quickly -- typically, a dozen or more new packages are uploaded every week.
This number is larger just before a new major release.  To deal with this
avalanche, many people prefer to use an automated programs.  Several different
packages are available for this purpose:
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a name="s-apt">8.2.1 APT</a>
</h3>

<p>
APT is a management system for software packages, namely Debian binary and
source packages.  apt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and
APT dselect method is an interface to APT through <code>dselect</code>, both of
which provide a simpler, safer way to install and upgrade packages.

<p>
APT features complete installation ordering, multiple source capability and
several other unique features, see the User's Guide in
<samp>/usr/share/doc/apt/guide.html/index.html</samp>.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a name="s-dpkg-ftp">8.2.2 dpkg-ftp</a>
</h3>

<p>
This is an access method for <code>dselect</code>.  It can be invoked from
within <code>dselect</code>, thereby allowing a user the ability to download
files and install them directly in one step.  To do this, bring up the
<code>dselect</code> program, choose option &quot;0&quot; (&quot;Choose the
access method to use&quot;), highlight the option &quot;ftp&quot; then specify
the remote hostname and directory.  <code>dpkg-ftp</code> will then
automatically download the files that are selected (either in this session of
<code>dselect</code> or earlier ones).

<p>
Note that, unlike the <code>mirror</code> program, <code>dpkg-ftp</code> does
not grab everything at a mirror site.  Rather, it downloads only those files
which you have selected (when first starting up <code>dpkg-ftp</code>), and
which need to be updated.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a name="s-mirror">8.2.3 mirror</a>
</h3>

<p>
This Perl script, and its (optional) manager program called
<code>mirror-master</code>, can be used to fetch user-specified parts of a
directory tree from a specified host <em>via</em> anonymous FTP.

<p>
<code>mirror</code> is particularly useful for downloading large volumes of
software.  After the first time files have been downloaded from a site, a file
called <samp>.mirrorinfo</samp> is stored on the local host.  Changes to the
remote filesystem are tracked automatically by <code>mirror</code>, which
compares this file to a similar file on the remote system and downloads only
changed files.

<p>
The <code>mirror</code> program is generally useful for updating local copies
of remote directory trees.  The files fetched need not be Debian files.  (Since
<code>mirror</code> is a Perl script, it can also run on non-Unix systems.)
Though the <code>mirror</code> program provides mechanisms for excluding files
names of which match user-specified strings, this program is most useful when
the objective is to download whole directory trees, rather than selected
packages.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a name="s-dftp">8.2.4 dftp</a>
</h3>

<p>
This Perl script can be used to fetch user-specified Debian packages from a
specified host.  It begins by downloading the Packages.gz files for the
directories specified by the user (e.g.  stable, contrib, non-free) and
presents him with a list of packages.  These are placed in various sections:
new upgrades, downgrades, new packages, ignored upgrades, and ignored packages.
The user then selects the packages he wants and dftp downloads and installs
them.  This makes it very easy to have your Debian system 100% current all the
time without downloading packages that you are not going to install.

<p>
<code>dftp</code> can be used to call <code>dselect</code> (see <a
href="ch-pkgtools.html#s-dselect">dselect, Section 7.1.2</a>), thereby
providing an integrated way to fetch and update the Debian packages on one's
system.  When the installation is finished, another <code>dftp</code> command
can be used to remove the package archive (&quot;.deb&quot;) files.  Changes to
the remote filesystem are tracked automatically by <code>dftp</code>, which
compares the local Packages.gz file to the files on the remote system.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a name="s-dpkg-mountable">8.2.5 dpkg-mountable</a>
</h3>

<p>
dpkg-mountable adds an access method called `mountable' to dselect's list,
which allows you to install of any filesystem specified in /etc/fstab (e.g.  a
normal hard disk partition, or an NFS server), which it will automatically
mount and umount for you if necessary.

<p>
It also has some extra features not found in the standard dselect methods, such
as provision for a local file tree (either parallel to the main distribution or
totally separate), and only getting packages which are required, rather than
the time-consuming recursive directory scan, as well as logging of all dpkg
actions in the install method.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-upgradesingle">8.3 Must I go into single user mode in order to upgrade a package?</a>
</h2>

<p>
No.  Packages can be upgraded in place, even in running systems.  Debian has a
<samp>start-stop-daemon</samp> program that is invoked to stop, then restart
running process if necessary during a package upgrade.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-savedebs">8.4 Do I have to keep all those .deb archive files on my disk?</a>
</h2>

<p>
No.  If you have downloaded the files to your disk (which is not absolutely
necessary, see above for dpkg-ftp or dftp descriptions), then after you have
installed the packages, you can remove them from your system.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-keepingalog">8.5 How can I keep a log of the packages I added to the system?</a>
</h2>

<p>
<code>dpkg</code> keeps a record of the packages that have been unpacked,
configured, removed, and/or purged, but does not (currently) keep a log of
terminal activity that occured while a package was being so manipulated.  Some
users overcome this simply by using <code>tee</code>, like this:

<pre>
     dpkg -iGOEB -R main/binary non-free/binary contrib/binary | \
         tee -a /root/dpkg.log
</pre>

<p>
The same command written using long options:

<pre>
     dpkg --install --refuse-downgrade --selected-only \
       --skip-same-version --auto-deconfigure \
       --recursive main/binary non-free/binary contrib/binary | \
         tee -a /root/dpkg.log
</pre>
</p>
