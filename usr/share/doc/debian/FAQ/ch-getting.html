The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ<br>
Chapter 2 Getting and Installing Debian GNU/Linux
</h1>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-version">2.1 What is the latest version of Debian?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Currently there are two versions of Debian GNU/Linux:

<dl>

<p>
<dt><em>release 2.2, a.k.a. the `stable' distribution</em></dt>
<dd>
This is stable and well tested software, it changes if major security or
usability fixes are incorporated.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><em>the `unstable' distribution</em></dt>
<dd>
This is the version currently under development; it is updated continuously.
You can retrieve packages from the `unstable' archive on any Debian FTP site
and use them to upgrade your system at any time, but you may not expect the
system to be as usable or as stable as before - that's why it's called
`<strong>unstable</strong>'!
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Please see <a href="ch-ftparchives.html#s-dists">How many Debian distributions
are there in the <samp>dists</samp> directory?, Section 5.2</a> for more
information.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-boot-floppies">2.2 Where/how can I get the Debian installation disks?</a>
</h2>

<p>
You can get the installation disks by downloading the appropriate files from
the Debian FTP site: <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/</a></code>
and its <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">mirrors</a></code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-cdrom">2.3 How do I install the Debian from CD-ROMs?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Linux supports the ISO 9660 (CD-ROM) file system with Rock Ridge extensions
(formerly known as &quot;High Sierra&quot;).  Several <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors">vendors</a></code> provide Debian
GNU/Linux in this format.

<p>
Warning: When installing from CD-ROM, it is usually not a good idea to choose
dselect's <samp>cdrom</samp> access method.  This method is usually very slow.
The <samp>mountable</samp> and <samp>apt</samp> methods, for example, are much
better for installing from CD-ROM (see <a
href="ch-uptodate.html#s-dpkg-mountable">dpkg-mountable, Section 8.2.5</a> and
<a href="ch-uptodate.html#s-apt">APT, Section 8.2.1</a>).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-cdimages">2.4 I have my own CD-writer, are there CD images available somewhere?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Yes.  To make it easier for CD vendors to provide high quality disks, we
provide the <code><a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/">Official CD
images</a></code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-floppy">2.5 Can I install it from a pile of floppy disks?</a>
</h2>

<p>
First of all, a warning: whole Debian GNU/Linux is way too large to be
installed from media as small as a standard 1.44MB floppy disk - you may not
find installing from floppies a very pleasant experience.

<p>
Copy the Debian packages onto formatted floppy disks.  Either a DOS, the native
Linux &quot;ext2&quot;, or the &quot;minix&quot; format will do; one just has
to use a mount command appropriate to the floppy being used.

<p>
Using floppy disks has these complications:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Short MS-DOS filenames: If you are trying to place Debian package files onto
MS-DOS formatted disks, you will find that their names are generally too long,
and do not conform to the MS-DOS 8.3 filename limitation.  To overcome this,
Debian developers make all of their packages available by 8.3 filenames in
separate &quot;msdos&quot; subdirectories (<samp>stable/msdos-i386/</samp>,
<samp>contrib/msdos-i386/</samp> and <samp>non-free/msdos-i386/</samp>).  The
files in these subdirectories are merely symbolic links to the Debian archive
files; the files do not differ from the files in the <samp>binary-i386/</samp>,
etc.  directories.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Large file sizes: Some packages are larger than 1.44 MBytes, and will not fit
onto a single floppy disk.  To solve this problem, use the dpkg-split tool (see
<a href="ch-pkgtools.html#s-dpkg-split">dpkg-split, Section 7.1.5</a>),
available in the <samp>tools</samp> directory at <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/</a></code> and
its <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist.html">mirrors</a></code>.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You must have support in the kernel for floppy disks in order to read and write
to floppy disk; most kernels come with floppy drive support included in them.

<p>
To mount a floppy disk under the mount point <samp>/floppy</samp> (a directory
which should have been created during installation), use:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<pre>
     mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /floppy/
</pre>

<p>
if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an MS-DOS filesystem,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<pre>
     mount -t msdos /dev/fd1 /floppy/
</pre>

<p>
if the floppy disk is in drive B: and has an MS-DOS filesystem,
</li>

<p>
<li>
<pre>
     mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy/
</pre>

<p>
if the floppy disk is in drive A: and has an ext2 (i.e., a normal Linux)
filesystem.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-remoteinstall">2.6 Can I get and install Debian directly from a remote Internet site?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Yes.  There are several methods for doing this:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<strong>Using APT:</strong> install the <code>apt</code> package, and edit the
<samp>/etc/apt/sources.list</samp> file to suit your needs.  You should change
it to include information about a Debian mirror closest to you.  Details on
this can be found in <code>apt-get(8)</code> and <code>sources.list(8)</code>
manual pages, as well as in the APT User's Guide, in
<samp>/usr/share/doc/apt/guide.html/index.html</samp>.

<p>
Then run

<pre>
     apt-get update
</pre>

<p>
followed by

<pre>
     apt-get upgrade
</pre>

<p>
and your system will be upgraded to the latest Debian release.
</li>

<p>
<li>
<strong>Using dselect and dpkg-ftp:</strong> install the <code>dpkg-ftp</code>
package (see <a href="ch-uptodate.html#s-dpkg-ftp">dpkg-ftp, Section
8.2.2</a>).

<p>
Then invoke the program <code>dselect</code>, which will call
<code>dpkg-ftp</code> for you, guide you through the selection of packages,
then install the packages, without every downloading the packages themselves to
your machine.  This method is designed to save the user both disk space and
time.

<p>
Dselect will ask you for the fully qualified domain name of the anonymous ftp
site you plan to use (if you don't know of any, try ftp.debian.org or
http.us.debian.org).

<p>
It'll also ask you for the directory which contains the files you want to
install, or the subdirectories which contain files you want to install.  This
directory must contain a file called &quot;Packages&quot; (or its compressed
equivalent, &quot;Packages.gz&quot;), usually dists/stable/main/binary-ARCH,
where ARCH stands for your machine architecture.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Please note that when you get and install the packages, you'll still have them
kept in your /var directory hierarchy, so remember to delete extra files, or to
move them someplace else (hint: use <code>apt-move</code>), or your partition
may overflow.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-tape">2.7 Can I get and install Debian from a tape device?</a>
</h2>

<p>
At present, installing packages directly from tape is not supported.  One can
however, use <samp>tar</samp>, <samp>cpio</samp>, or <samp>afio</samp> to copy
Debian archive files onto a tape, then copy them onto your local disk for
installation.  In the same vein, floppy disks containing &quot;tar&quot; files
would have to be copied onto a local disk before they could be managed with the
Debian package tools.
