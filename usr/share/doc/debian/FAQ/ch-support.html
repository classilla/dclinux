The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ<br>
Chapter 11 Getting support for Debian GNU/Linux
</h1>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-debiandocs">11.1 What other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?</a>
</h2>

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Installation instructions for the current release: see <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install</a></code>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Packaging manual is the primary documentation on the technical aspects of
creating Debian binary and source packages.

<p>
You can find it in the <code>packaging-manual</code> package, or at <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/packaging.html.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/packaging.html.tar.gz</a></code>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Policy manual documents the policy requirements for the distribution, i.e.  the
structure and contents of the Debian archive, several design issues of the
operating system, as well as technical requirements that each package must
satisfy to be included in the distribution.

<p>
Get it from the <code>debian-policy</code> package, or at <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.html.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.html.tar.gz</a></code>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Documentation on installed Debian packages: Most packages have files that are
unpacked into <samp>/usr/doc/PACKAGE</samp>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Documentation on the Linux project: The Debian package <code>doc-linux</code>
installs all of the most recent versions of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the
<code><a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org">Linux Documentation Project</a></code>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Unix-style `man' pages: Most commands have manual pages written in the style of
the original Unix 'man' files.  They are referenced by the section of the 'man'
directory where they reside: e.g., foo(3) refers to a manual page which resides
in /usr/share/man/man3/, and it can be called by executing the command:
<samp>man 3 foo</samp>, or just <samp>man foo</samp> if section 3 is the first
one containing a page on <samp>foo</samp>.

<p>
One can learn which directory of <samp>/usr/share/man/</samp> contains a
certain manual page by executing <samp>man -w foo</samp>.

<p>
New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general system
commands are not available until they install these packages:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<samp>man-db</samp>, which contains the <samp>man</samp> program itself, and
other programs for manipulating the manual pages.
</li>

<p>
<li>
<samp>manpages</samp>, which contains the system manual pages.  (see <a
href="ch-software.html#s-nonenglish">How does Debian support non-English
languages?, Section 4.8</a>).
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<p>
<li>
GNU-style `info' pages: User documentation for many commands, particularly GNU
tools, is available not in `man' pages, but in `info' files which can be read
by the GNU tool <samp>info</samp>, by running <samp>M-x info</samp> within GNU
Emacs, or with some other Info page viewer.

<p>
Its main advantage over the original `man' pages are that it is a hypertext
system.  It does <em>not</em> require the WWW, however; <samp>info</samp> can
be run from a plain text console.  It was designed by Richard Stallman and
preceded the WWW.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Note that you may access a lot of documentation on your system by using a WWW
browser, through `dwww' or `dhelp' commands, found in respective packages.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-onlineresources">11.2 Are there any on-line resources for discussing Debian?</a>
</h2>

<p>
There are a lot of Debian-related mailing lists.

<p>
On a system with the <code>doc-debian</code> package installed there is a
complete list of mailing lists in
<code>/usr/share/doc/debian/mailing-lists.txt</code>.

<p>
To subscribe to debian-X (for X in announce, user, etc.), send mail to
debian-X-request@lists.debian.org with the word &quot;subscribe&quot; in the
Subject: header.  If you have a forms-capable World Wide Web browser, you can
subscribe the mailing lists using the <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe.html">WWW form</a></code>.
You can also un-subscribe using that form.

<p>
The list manager's e-mail address is <code><a
href="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</a></code>,
in case you have any trouble.

<p>
Archives of the Debian mailing lists are available via WWW at <code><a
href="http://lists.debian.org/">http://lists.debian.org/</a></code>.

<p>
Users can address questions to individual package maintainers, since their
e-mail addresses are provided in the Debian control file (see section <a
href="ch-pkg_basics.html#s-controlfile">What is a Debian control file?, Section
6.4</a>) that is included within each package.  One can also learn the
maintainers' names and e-mail addresses by searching the &quot;Packages&quot;
file, since this file is just a concatenation of all the available package
control files in a particular directory tree.  To extract a control file from a
particular Debian package, use the command:

<pre>
     dpkg --info packageName_VVV-RRR.deb
</pre>

<p>
Users should post non-Debian-specific questions to one of the Linux USENET
groups, which are named comp.os.linux.* or linux.*.  There are several lists of
Linux Usenet newsgroups and other related resources on the WWW, e.g.  on the
<code><a href="http://www.linux.org/docs/usenet.html">Linux Online</a></code>
and <code><a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/help/online.html">LinuxJournal</a></code>
sites.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-mailinglistconduct">11.3 What is the code of conduct for the mailing lists?</a>
</h2>

<p>
When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Do not flame; it is not polite.  The people developing Debian are all
volunteers, donating their time, energy and money in an attempt to bring the
Debian project together.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Do not use foul language; besides, some people receive the lists via packet
radio, where swearing is illegal.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Make sure that you are using the proper list.  <em>Never</em> post your
(un)subscription requests to the mailing list itself[<a href="footnotes.html#1"
name="fr1">1</a>]
</li>

<p>
<li>
See section <a href="ch-support.html#s-bugreport">How do I report a bug in
Debian?, Section 11.6</a> for notes on reporting bugs.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a name="s-advertising">11.3.1 Mailing list advertising policy</a>
</h3>

<p>
The Debian GNU/Linux mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment.
We offer a fee waiver if you can show us the cancelled check for a $1000 (U.S.)
or more donation to the Free Software Foundation earmarked for
&quot;Debian&quot;.  One donation per advertisement, please.  If you do not
wish to donate, simply post your advertisement to the list, and the operator of
the mailing lists will bill $1999 (U.S).  The list operator will donate this
amount, minus the expense of collecting it, to FSF.

<p>
By the act of posting your advertisement you agree to accept responsibility for
the fee, you agree to indemnify the mailing-list operator against any legal
claims from you or others in connection with your advertisement, and you agree
to pay any legal and business expenses incurred in collecting late payment.
Our liability to you is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your message.

<p>
Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements.  You must consult the mailing-list operator in advance of
posting for any reduction or fee waiver.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="s-searchtools">11.4 Is there a quick way to search for information on Debian GNU/Linux?</a>
</h2>

<p>
There are a variety of search engines that serve documentation related to
Debian:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
<code><a href="http://www.debian.org/search">Debian WWW search site</a></code>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
<code><a href="http://www.dejanews.com/">DejaNews news search
service</a></code>.  To find out what experiences people have had with finding
drivers for Western Digital controllers, try searching on this phrase:
<samp>linux &amp; WD</samp> This tells DejaNews to report any postings
containing both the string &quot;linux&quot; AND the string &quot;WD&quot;.
(as a side note: when one of the authors of this text used it, he discovered
that his WD card (which he had only had for 6 months) had been declared
outmoded by Adaptec, because they bought WD then.  So there were no drivers
available.  Bless Adaptec's hearts.)
</li>

<p>
<li>
Any of the web spidering engines (such as <code><a
href="http://www.altavista.com/">AltaVista</a></code> or <code><a
href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></code>) can also be used to search
Usenet (although they may not be quite as up to date as DejaNews).

<p>
For example, searching on the string &quot;cgi-perl&quot; gives a more detailed
explanation of this package than the brief description field in its control
file.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-buglogs">11.5 Are there logs of known bugs?</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Debian GNU/Linux distribution has a bug tracking system (BTS) which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers.  Each bug is given a number,
and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with.

<p>
Copies of this information are available at <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/</a></code>.

<p>
A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via e-mail.
In order to get the instructions, send an e-mail to request@bugs.debian.org
with &quot;help&quot; in the body.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a name="s-bugreport">11.6 How do I report a bug in Debian?</a>
</h2>

<p>
If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for reporting a
bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of several ways:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
By anonymous FTP.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in the file
<samp>doc/bug-reporting.txt</samp>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting.html">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting.html</a></code>.
</li>

<p>
<li>
On any Debian system with the <code>doc-debian</code> package installed.  The
instructions are in the file <code>/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt</code>.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You can use the packages <code>bug</code> or <code>reportbug</code> that will
guide you through the reporting process and mail the message to the proper
address, with some extra details about your system added automatically.

<p>
If you want to mail the report with a MUA, send a message to <code><a
href="mailto:submit@bugs.debian.org">submit@bugs.debian.org</a></code>, first
line of which containing a line like

<pre>
     Package: packagename
</pre>

<p>
(replace &quot;packagename&quot; with the name of the package).  The rest of
the message should contain the description of the bug (please make it
moderately detailed), Debian release you are using, and versions of that and
relevant packages.

<p>
Expect to get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report.  It will also be
automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug log and
forwarded to the debian-bugs-dist mailing list.

<p>
If one were to identify a bug that was common to many programs, then rather
than entering dozens of very similar bug reports, one might prefer to send
individual bugs to <code><a
href="mailto:maintonly@bugs.debian.org">maintonly@bugs.debian.org</a></code>
(instead of the submit@...  address) to reach only the respective package
maintainers, and then send a summary report to debian-devel and/or
debian-bugs-dist mailing lists.

<p>
Additionally, there exists a Debian package checker, called <code><a
href="http://www.debian.org/lintian/">Lintian</a></code>, which is designed to
mechanically check Debian packages for policy violations and common packaging
errors.  Thus, if you detect a bug in a package which is likely to appear in
other packages too, it might be better to get in contact with the Lintian
maintainers at <code><a
href="mailto:lintian-maint@debian.org">lintian-maint@debian.org</a></code> so
that a new check is written for Lintian instead of reporting the bug directly.
This will most likely prevent the bug to appear in future versions of the
package again, or in any other package of the distribution.

<p>
You can also use <code><a
href="mailto:quiet@bugs.debian.org">quiet@bugs.debian.org</a></code>, to submit
bug reports to the BTS only, without having them sent either to
debian-bugs-dist or to the maintainer.  This `quiet' address is used very
rarely, e.g.  when you want to send some minor data to your report, that should
just be recorded in the log, or when you want to record something in the BTS
log but you already sent it to the maintainer.
