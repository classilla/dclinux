This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Debian Base
Password and Group files, plus the update-passwd utility to handle
upgrades. The master files were originally written by Ian Murdock
<imurdock@debian.org> and Bruce Perens <bruce@pixar.com>.

update-passwd was written by Galen Hazelwood <galenh@micron.net>,
and later rewritten from scratch by Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org> .
