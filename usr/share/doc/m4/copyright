This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU m4 macro
processor. GNU `m4' has been originally written by Rene' Seindal, from
Denmark, with subsequent changes by Franc,ois Pinard and other volunteers
on the Internet. A list of contributors to the GNU program is in the
THANKS file in the source distribution, or appended below in the binary
package.

This package was first put together by Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.

The GNU sources for this release were obtained from

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.tar.gz.

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files.
