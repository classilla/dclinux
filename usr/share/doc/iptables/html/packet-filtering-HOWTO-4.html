<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Who the hell are you, and why are you playing with my kernel?</A></H2>

<P>I'm Rusty; the Linux IP Firewall maintainer and just another working
coder who happened to be in the right place at the right time.  I
wrote ipchains (see 
<A HREF="packet-filtering-HOWTO-3.html#filter-linux">How Do I Packet Filter Under Linux?</A> above for due credit to the people who did the
actual work), and learnt enough to get packet filtering right this
time.  I hope.
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.watchguard.com">WatchGuard</A>, an excellent
firewall company who sell the really nice plug-in Firebox, offered to
pay me to do nothing, so I could spend all my time writing this stuff,
and maintaining my previous stuff.  I predicted 6 months, and it took
12, but I felt by the end that it had been done Right.  Many rewrites,
a hard-drive crash, a laptop being stolen, a couple of corrupted
filesystems and one broken screen later, here it is.
<P>
<P>While I'm here, I want to clear up some people's misconceptions: I am
no kernel guru.  I know this, because my kernel work has brought me
into contact with some of them: David S. Miller, Alexey Kuznetsov,
Andi Kleen, Alan Cox.  However, they're all busy doing the deep magic,
leaving me to wade in the shallow end where it's safe.
