The HOWTOs and the sourcecode for iptables were downloaded from
http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org. Some modifications were made to the
Makefiles. Christoph Lameter (christoph@lameter.com) created the Debian
package March 26, 2000.

The copyright of iptables is the GPL (see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL).

iptables grew out of the netfilter software whose ancestor in turn was the
ipchains software. A large number of people contributed to the software over
the years.

The core team developing iptables consisted of:

Marc Boucher and Rusty Russell
