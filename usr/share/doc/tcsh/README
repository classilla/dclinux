Changes for new release 6.07.06


The sources used for this package are still unreleased. I downloaded them as
part of the debugging process for the runaway tcsh processes problem. It is
version 6.07.06. 

The conffile /etc/csh.cshrc has now as default, the "del" key bound to
delete-char. The manual file has been updated to reflect this.

You may want to set a symbolic link to /usr/bin/tcsh in
/usr/local/bin directory. Most tcsh scripts use this path. There is a FAQ
describing why csh programming is considered harmful, that can be found in the
the ftp site perl.com in /pub/perl/versus/csh.whynot.gz. 
Setting the link up it's also useful when you have a network
with various Unix boxen and users which use /usr/local/bin/tcsh as
their shells.

There are three tcsh related mailing lists:
tcsh             * TCSH Development Team
tcsh-bugs        * TCSH Bug Reports
tcsh-diffs       * TCSH Development Team with Diffs
