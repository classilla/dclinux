10/24/93 -replace previous words file with the words file provided by 
	  Rik Faith, faith@cs.unc.edu.  This package can be found at 
	  ftp.cs.unc.edu in /pub/faith/linux/utils/linux.words.2.tar.gz

9/30/93 - changed 'mkdir' to 'mkdir -p' in the top level Makefile so 
	  intermediate directories will be created if they don't exist.

9/25/93 - Top level Makefile now creates the directories DESTDIR, MANDIR,
	  and LIBDIR if they do not exist before trying to install the 
	  individual programs.

9/25/93 - Fixed makefiles to inherit defines from upper level makefiles.
	  Also fixed hard coded pathnames in .h files to be taken from the
	  makefiles.

9/23/93 - [bog]  Modified the end of game behavior to be more intuitive.
	  Original behavior can be set by defining PURE in CFLAGS.

9/23/93 - [bog]  Fixed a bug in bog which caused a crash at the end of 
	  displaying the help.  
	  "extern char *version" -> "extern char version[]"
	  Aren't these two equivalent???  I guess not :)  Thanks Andrew
	  Kuchling for spotting this one.
