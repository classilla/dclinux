I have replaced the old hunt port, which was rather a mess, with a version
based on that in NetBSD-current.  This version now uses internet domain
sockets rather than Unix domain sockets, but is almost completely untested.
The original README.linux is below.

Finally, we have a version of hunt that appears to work!!!!!!
It hasn't been extensively tested, and may contain many bugs.  Note,
any problems would most likely be due to my mangling/porting the code.
The original authors have done a nice job.

Also, you can go through the Makefile and specify your desired game
parameters.  Be careful what you change, this Linux version is rather
fragile.  Any volunteers to sort out running over a network?

One hint for those who have never played hunt before ...
  1.  Start the hunt driver:  % /usr/sbin/huntd &
  2.  Now start hunt:         % /usr/games/hunt [options]
In other words, for best results, get the driver running first.

Happy hunting!  (And if you ever see "black tite" show up in one of your
hunt games, RUN!!!!!)
