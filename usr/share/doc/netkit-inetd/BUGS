inetd:
	- will shut down services respawning too fast. Should bring them 
	  up again after a few minutes.
	- I'd appreciate if someone could try the Phrack inetd-killer of
	  a couple of months ago and let me know the results, if any.

rpcgen:
	- should look for cpp in more places (eg, /usr/bin, /usr/libexec)
