Colorized `ls' for Debian (GNU) Linux.
Last revised by Erick Branderhorst, August 2, 1996 (fileutils 3.13).

The Debian color-ls package is obsolete since the release of GNU
fileutils version 3.13 which includes colorized `ls', `dir', `vdir'
and `dircolors'.

Options for colorized `ls' are described in the on-line help (`ls
--help') and the fileutils info pages.  Color support can be activated
by typing `ls --color'.  Man pages exist but aren't kept up to date.

Dirk.Eddelbuettel@qed.econ.queensu.ca suggested that the following
could be included in /etc/profile (I modified it a little):

--
eval `dircolors`
alias ls='ls --color=auto ';
alias ll='ls -l';
alias dir='ls --color=auto --format=vertical';
alias vdir='ls --color=auto --format=long';
alias ols='/bin/ls';
--

The documentation for color-ls will improve with time and in response
to user feedback.  Please consider this the Alpha version of this
document.
