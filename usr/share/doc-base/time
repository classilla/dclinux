Title: The GNU time Command
Author: David MacKenzie
Abstract: The GNU 'time' command runs another program, 
	then displays information about the resources used by that 
	program, collected by the system while the program was 
	running. You can select which information is reported 
	and the format in which it is shown, or have `time' save 
	the information in a file instead of display it on the 
	screen.
