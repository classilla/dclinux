Title: automake
Abstract: Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.  The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of
 `make' macro definitions (with rules being thrown in occasionally).
 The generated `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile
 standards.
