=head1 NAME

charnames - define character names for C<\N{named}> string literal escape.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use charnames ':full';
  print "\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA} is called sigma.\n";

  use charnames ':short';
  print "\N{greek:Sigma} is an upper-case sigma.\n";

  use charnames qw(cyrillic greek);
  print "\N{sigma} is Greek sigma, and \N{be} is Cyrillic b.\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pragma C<use charnames> supports arguments C<:full>, C<:short> and
script names.  If C<:full> is present, for expansion of
C<\N{CHARNAME}}> string C<CHARNAME> is first looked in the list of
standard Unicode names of chars.  If C<:short> is present, and
C<CHARNAME> has the form C<SCRIPT:CNAME>, then C<CNAME> is looked up
as a letter in script C<SCRIPT>.  If pragma C<use charnames> is used
with script name arguments, then for C<\N{CHARNAME}}> the name
C<CHARNAME> is looked up as a letter in the given scripts (in the
specified order).

For lookup of C<CHARNAME> inside a given script C<SCRIPTNAME>
this pragma looks for the names

  SCRIPTNAME CAPITAL LETTER CHARNAME
  SCRIPTNAME SMALL LETTER CHARNAME
  SCRIPTNAME LETTER CHARNAME

in the table of standard Unicode names.  If C<CHARNAME> is lowercase,
then the C<CAPITAL> variant is ignored, otherwise the C<SMALL> variant is
ignored.

=head1 CUSTOM TRANSLATORS

The mechanism of translation of C<\N{...}> escapes is general and not
hardwired into F<charnames.pm>.  A module can install custom
translations (inside the scope which C<use>s the module) with the
following magic incantation:

    use charnames ();		# for $charnames::hint_bits
    sub import {
	shift;
	$^H |= $charnames::hint_bits;
	$^H{charnames} = \&translator;
    }

Here translator() is a subroutine which takes C<CHARNAME> as an
argument, and returns text to insert into the string instead of the
C<\N{CHARNAME}> escape.  Since the text to insert should be different
in C<bytes> mode and out of it, the function should check the current
state of C<bytes>-flag as in:

    use bytes ();			# for $bytes::hint_bits
    sub translator {
	if ($^H & $bytes::hint_bits) {
	    return bytes_translator(@_);
	}
	else {
	    return utf8_translator(@_);
	}
    }

=head1 BUGS

Since evaluation of the translation function happens in a middle of
compilation (of a string literal), the translation function should not
do any C<eval>s or C<require>s.  This restriction should be lifted in
a future version of Perl.
