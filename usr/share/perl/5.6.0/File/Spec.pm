=head1 NAME

File::Spec - portably perform operations on file names

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use File::Spec;

	$x=File::Spec->catfile('a', 'b', 'c');

which returns 'a/b/c' under Unix. Or:

	use File::Spec::Functions;

	$x = catfile('a', 'b', 'c');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file
specifications (usually called "file names", but not to be confused with the
contents of a file, or Perl's file handles), such as concatenating several
directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path
is rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code
written by Andreas KE<ouml>nig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya
Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.

Since these functions are different for most operating systems, each set of
OS specific routines is available in a separate module, including:

	File::Spec::Unix
	File::Spec::Mac
	File::Spec::OS2
	File::Spec::Win32
	File::Spec::VMS

The module appropriate for the current OS is automatically loaded by
File::Spec. Since some modules (like VMS) make use of facilities available
only under that OS, it may not be possible to load all modules under all
operating systems.

Since File::Spec is object oriented, subroutines should not called directly,
as in:

	File::Spec::catfile('a','b');

but rather as class methods:

	File::Spec->catfile('a','b');

For simple uses, L<File::Spec::Functions> provides convenient functional
forms of these methods.

For a list of available methods, please consult L<File::Spec::Unix>,
which contains the entire set, and which is inherited by the modules for
other platforms. For further information, please see L<File::Spec::Mac>,
L<File::Spec::OS2>, L<File::Spec::Win32>, or L<File::Spec::VMS>.
