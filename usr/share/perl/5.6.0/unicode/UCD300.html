<h2>Introduction</h2>  
  
<p>The Unicode Character Database is a set of files that define the Unicode   
  
character properties and internal mappings. For more information about character   
  
properties and mappings, see <i><a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/u2.html">The   
  
Unicode Standard</a></i>.</p>  
  
<p>The Unicode Character Database has been updated to reflect Version 3.0 of the   
  
Unicode Standard, with many characters added to those published in Version 2.0.   
  
A number of corrections have also been made to case mappings or other errors in   
  
the database noted since the publication of Version 2.0. Normative bidirectional   
  
properties have also been modified to reflect decisions of the Unicode Technical   
  
Committee.</p>  
  
<p>For more information on versions of the Unicode Standard and how to reference   
  
them, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/</a>.</p>  
  
<h2>Conformance</h2>  
  
<p>Character properties may be either normative or informative. <i>Normative</i>   
  
means that implementations that claim conformance to the Unicode Standard (at a   
  
particular version) and which make use of a particular property or field must   
  
follow the specifications of the standard for that property or field in order to   
  
be conformant. The term <i>normative</i> when applied to a property or field of   
  
the Unicode Character Database, does <i>not</i> mean that the value of that   
  
field will never change. Corrections and extensions to the standard in the   
  
future may require minor changes to normative values, even though the Unicode   
  
Technical Committee strives to minimize such changes. An<i> informative </i>property   
  
or field is strongly recommended, but a conformant implementation is free to use   
  
or change such values as it may require while still being conformant to the   
  
standard. Particular implementations may choose to override the properties and   
  
mappings that are not normative. In that case, it is up to the implementer to   
  
establish a protocol to convey that information.</p>  
  
<h2>Files</h2>  
  
<p>The following summarizes the files in the Unicode Character Database. &nbsp;For   
  
more information about these files, see the referenced technical report or   
  
section of Unicode Standard, Version 3.0.</p>  
  
<p><b>UnicodeData.txt (Chapter 4)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>The main file in the Unicode Character Database.</li>  
  
  <li>For detailed information on the format, see <a href="UnicodeData.html">UnicodeData.html</a>.   
  
    This file also characterizes which properties are normative and which are   
  
    informative.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>PropList.txt (Chapter 4)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>Additional informative properties list: <i>Alphabetic, Ideographic,</i>   
  
    and <i>Mathematical</i>, among others.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>SpecialCasing.txt (Chapter 4)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>List of informative special casing properties, including one-to-many   
  
    mappings such as SHARP S =&gt; &quot;SS&quot;, and locale-specific mappings,   
  
    such as for Turkish <i>dotless i</i>.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>Blocks.txt (Chapter 14)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>List of normative block names.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>Jamo.txt (Chapter 4)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>List of normative Jamo short names, used in deriving HANGUL SYLLABLE names   
  
    algorithmically.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>ArabicShaping.txt (Section 8.2)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>Basic Arabic and Syriac character shaping properties, such as initial,   
  
    medial and final shapes. These properties are normative for minimal shaping   
  
    of Arabic and Syriac. </li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>NamesList.txt (Chapter 14)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>This file duplicates some of the material in the UnicodeData file, and   
  
    adds informative annotations uses in the character charts, as printed in the   
  
    Unicode Standard. </li>  
  
  <li><b>Note: </b>The information in NamesList.txt and Index.txt files matches   
  
    the appropriate version of the book. Changes in the Unicode Character   
  
    Database since then may not be reflected in these files, since they are   
  
    primarily of archival interest.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>Index.txt (Chapter 14)</b>  
  
<ul>  
  
  <li>Informative index to Unicode characters, as printed in the Unicode   
  
    Standard</li>  
  
  <li><b>Note: </b>The information in NamesList.txt and Index.txt files matches   
  
    the appropriate version of the book. Changes in the Unicode Character   
  
    Database since then may not be reflected in these files, since they are   
  
    primarily of archival interest.</li>  
  
</ul>  
  
<p><b>CompositionExclusions.txt (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/">UTR#15
