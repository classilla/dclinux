.SH NAME
gtv \- MPEG audio (MP3) and video (MPEG-1) player with GTK+ GUI

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgtv\fR \fIfile\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gtv
is an MPEG audio and video player that uses the SDL MPEG Player Library.
It can play back MPEG audio (layer 1, 2 and 3), MPEG video (MPEG-1) and
MPEG system (audio and video combined) files. MPEG-2 video files (as found
on DVDs) are not supported.
.PP
The video player works best on a 16 bit color depth X11 display, 
it works on other color depths with reduced speed as well. You'll need a
CPU with 300 MHz or more to play back an MPEG system stream with 25 frames
per secons (fps) at full speed.
