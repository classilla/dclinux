# If called "uz", gunzips and extracts a gzip'd tar'd archive.
# If called "lz", gunzips and shows a listing of a gzip'd tar'd archive.

# Requires: gzip and tar in the user's path.  Should work with most tars.
# "-" is now used for backwards compatibility with antique tars, e.g. SCO.

# 1994/02/19	DCN	Created (as a trivial, but useful script)
# 1994/12/01	DCN	Combined uz and lz, added suffix handling
