=head1 SYNOPSIS

 debconf-loadtemplate owner file [file ..]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Loads one of more template files into the debconf database. The first
parameter specifies the owner of the templates (typically, the owner is the
name of a debian package). The remaining parameters are template files to
load.

=head1 WARNING

This program should never be used from a maintainer script of a package
that uses debconf! It may however, be useful in debugging, or to seed the
debconf database.
